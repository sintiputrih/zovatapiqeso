Initially, his content focused on ‘Let's Play’ videos, primarily featuring games like Minecraft and Call of Duty: Black Ops II. He also created videos where he estimated the wealth of fellow YouTubers, offered advice to aspiring creators, and provided commentary on YouTube drama. However, Jimmy himself rarely appeared in these early videos. By July 2013, his channel, originally named "That-dude," had approximately 240 subscribers.</span></p><p><span>Between 2015 and 2016, YouTubers popularity skyrocketed due to his "Worst Intros on YouTube" series, which playfully ridiculed video introductions. By mid-2016, he had accumulated around 30,000 subscribers. As his channel continued to flourish, MrBeast enlisted the help of four childhood friends, Chris Tyson, Chandler Hallow, Garrett Ronalds, and Jake Franklin, to contribute to his content. Franklin departed from the group in 2020, and Karl Jacobs, previously serving as a cameraman, took his place.</span></p><p><span>In January 2017, MrBeast gained significant attention by uploading a nearly day-long video in which he counted 100,000. The endeavor spanned 40 hours, with certain sections sped up to keep the video within 24 hours. During this time, his popularity surged further with daring stunts, such as using a hundred megaphones in an attempt to break glass, observing paint dry for an hour, and endeavoring to remain underwater for 24 hours (although he had to end the challenge due to health issues). Another notable, albeit unsuccessful, attempt involved spinning a fidget spinner for an entire day. By 2018, Donaldson had given away $1 million through his extravagant stunts, making him "YouTube's biggest philanthropist."</span></p><p><span>Jimmy's videos began featuring more ambitious challenges and substantial prizes as time progressed. Once his channel became successful, he hired four of his childhood friends namely, Chris Tyson, Chandler Hallow, Garrett Ronalds, and Jake Franklin. With the expansion of his content and channels (including gaming videos in 2020, reaction videos in 2021, and philanthropic videos also in 2021), MrBeast transformed from an independent YouTuber with a small group of friends into a fully-fledged production company known as MrBeast LLC. The company employed approximately 50 on-camera employees and an estimated 50 more off-camera, all receiving generous compensation for their work on MrBeast's videos. Jimmy himself assumed the role of CEO, overseeing various positions such as cameramen, editors, ADR techs, logistic techs, producers, accountants, lawyers, administrative staff, a personal bodyguard, a business manager, a talent manager, medical professionals for challenges, and construction workers responsible for building sets.</span></p><p><span>On July 28, 2022, MrBeast achieved a significant milestone by surpassing 100 million subscribers on his main channel, making him the fifth channel and second individual YouTuber to accomplish this feat.

So, I just got f****d, and we’re stuck in South Africa. I don’t collab much, but obviously, I’m with Logan [Paul]. He drags me out, and I am with this person at dinner. Then her friend just stopped by, who ended up becoming my girlfriend,” MrBeast said. Booysen is also known for playing games in distinct genres and has degrees in both law and psychology.

Questions concerning the long-term viability of individual financial donations were raised during the discussion. In March 2023, MrBeast was slammed for giving 20,000 pairs of shoes to the Barefoot No More initiative in South Africa, which aims to provide school shoes for the country's young people. Critics claimed that Jimmy was making money off people’s sufferings. In January 2023, MrBeast funded 1,000 people's cataract surgeries,&nbsp;which critics dubbed 'charity porn'. Recently, he also helped 1,000 hearing impaired people in listening ‘for the first time’, but many were quick to take a dig at MrBeast’s philanthropic effort.</span></strong></p><p><strong>Faking giveaway amount</strong></p><p><strong><span>In 2018, FlyyDoesYT, a YouTuber claimed the MrBeast was faking his giveaway videos. The 25-minute long accusation video was taken seriously by many. But, in response to his allegations, MrBeast asked him to approach people who have received the money for verification.</span></strong></p><p><strong>‘Bullying’ employees and ‘toxic’ work environment</strong></p><p><strong><span>MrBeast’s ex-editor Matt Turner, posted a video on social media in 2018 about MrBeast’s misbehavior. To The New York Times, Turner told, he was “yelled at, bullied, called mentally retarded and replaceable by MrBeast every single day”. He also alleged that MrBeast also deleted a project file for a video he was editing since the clip compilation of his philanthropic act didn’t equal the figure he had mentioned in the video title. The tweet thread was soon deleted. In May 2021 again, calling the work environment at MrBeast’s venture “toxic”, Turner alleged that when he was working for the YouTuber, he used to call him “mentally retarded”. Additionally, Turner said, he was never appreciated or credited for his hard work and effort. The same year, 11 people who worked for YouTube star told The New York Times, his "demeanor changed when the cameras weren’t around”.</span></strong></p><p><strong>Criticized for Using Homophobic Slurs</strong></p><p><strong><span>MrBeast faced backlash for the content of his early videos and posts. The YouTuber was criticized for using homophobic slurs and offensive jokes. His representative said MrBeast “has grown up and matured into someone that doesn’t speak like that”. According to an article published by ‘The Atlantic’ in 2018, MrBeast’s tweets showed offensive slurs and gay punchlines he used as jokes. When the article was published, his Twitter bio read, “Just because I’m gay doesn’t mean I’m gay.”</span></strong></p><p><strong>Accused of Racial Comment</strong></p><p><strong><span>In February 2021, a Clubhouse user, Farokh Sarmad accused Jimmy of kicking him off the stage for not being able to pronounce his name properly and to accommodate more female members.He also claimed that MrBeast misbehaved with him. The fact that MrBeast couldn’t pronounce his name right was taken as a racist comment by Sarmad. Although Sarmad was slammed by various YouTubers and fellow Clubhouse members on social media, he said, “To be kicked off because of my name is not right. And to not be given a chance to speak when other people who came on after me were given speaking time”. He also stated that before this incident in the US, he suffered racism in Paris, where he grew up and Canada.</span></strong></p><p><strong>Received flak for buying entire neighborhood for staff</strong></p><p><strong><span>MrBeast was under fire for covertly purchasing a community for himself, his family members and staff on a modest street just outside of Greenville, North Carolina, where he grew up. He bought five homes, all grouped together in a cul-de-sac. Three of the houses were purchased off-market since they weren't on the market for sale. When he received flak for this philanthropic endeavor, MrBeast hit back at critics stating, “Only I could get canceled for giving people a place to live with no strings attached.. All these company town tweets make no sense, I was just helping some people.”</span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoqKKks6q4xGikq2WSmq60wA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./meghan-markle-baby-archie-photo-princess-diana-tribute.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Princess Diana Is Honored in New Instagram Photo of Baby Archie Shared By Meghan &amp;amp; Harry">&larr;
