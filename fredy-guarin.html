Guarin is a three-in-one midfielder; he can play in the offensive midfield, the defensive midfield, or as the pivot in the middle. In a similar vein, he’s renowned for his inventiveness and his capacity to invent compelling narratives. His working life kicked off in 2002. Not only is Guarin a member of the Colombian national team, but he has also played for nine different teams.</p><p>While still a young player, Fredy made his mark on Colombian football at the second level. For Atletico Huila in 2002, Fredy was a key player. He took the field five times for the squad.</p><p>Fredy moved to a new squad in Colombia back in 2003. This time, though, he’s playing for Envigado in the Brazilian First Division. Guarin’s performances got steadily stronger over time, leaving a lasting effect on his audience.</p><p>Beginning in 2005, Guarin was a mainstay in Envigado’s starting lineup. He also became an integral component of the Colombian under-20 squad. This caused his price to skyrocket, and several teams pursued signing him. After much deliberation, Fredy decided to sign a six-month loan deal with Boca Juniors. Overall, he played in 38 games for Envigado and scored four times.</p><p>The midfielder trained with Boca Juniors’ junior team for the first six months. Despite this, the club had intentions of making the loan permanent. But Guarin had other ideas, and in August of 2006, he signed a loan deal to play for AS Saint-Etienne. Saint-Etienne is a French <a href=#>football team</a> that competes in France’s top division, Ligue 1.</p><p>Similarly, he played for Saint-Etienne 18 times and scored once. Saint-Etienne made Guarin a permanent addition to the team after he impressed the coaches and management. During his second stint at Saint-Etienne, Guarin played 18 games.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Settling in Porto</h3><p>Guarin joined FC Porto of Portugal’s top division after an impressive stint in France’s Ligue 1. In exchange for an unknown sum, he committed to a four-year term. The character had a tough time getting used to the new environment. It led to his appearing in public rarely.</p><p>Guarin could not establish himself as a regular starter after the departure of Raul Meireles, who played in the middle of the field. On the other hand, Guarin’s talents were greatly utilized during the 2011-12 season, as he logged over 40 games. Fredy’s contributions were crucial in Porto reclaiming their title as Portuguese champions.</p><p>In addition, he significantly impacted Porto’s performance in the Europa League. Guarin led Porto FC to the Europa League title with five goals. During the 2014 transfer window, Milan helped facilitate Guarin’s move to Juventus. When asked why the transfer didn’t go through, the athlete said he didn’t understand because he hadn’t asked to go.</p><p>In addition, the next season, he hurt his muscles and hamstring. The football player was subsequently forced to miss a few contests. Fredy left Italy after living there for five years to pursue new opportunities. On the same day, January 26, 2016, he signed with Shanghai Greenland Shenhua FC of the Chinese Super League.</p><p>Thirteen times Fredy Guarin has played for the Colombian U-17 and U-20 teams. Guarin has also contributed greatly to his country by earning 57 appearances for the national squad.</p><p>In a match on May 24, 2006, against Ecuador, Guarin made his Colombian national team debut.
