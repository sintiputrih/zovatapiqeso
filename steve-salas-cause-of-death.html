According to Villa, Bustillos “played a few gigs” before leaving and being eventually replaced by drummer Kenny Roman midway through 1972.</p><p>Steve Salas, a singer, bass player, and percussionist, performed with his brother in some fashion for more than a decade, most notably as the Salas Brothers. The duo worked on neighborhood functions, such as weddings and graduations.</p><p>Steve and Rudy Salas grew up in Lincoln Heights with their mother, Margaret Brambila, and father, Rudy Sr. Their uncle, Art Brambila, lived across the street.</p><p>He stayed less than two years before returning to Lincoln Heights and joined his brother as a member of the Chicano R&B group El Chicano.</p><p>In 1972, El Chicano released “Celebration,” in which Steve Salas and Freddie Sanchez were the featured vocalists in a cover of Van Morrison’s famed “Brown Eyed Girl.” Their version of the song climbed to No. 45 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart that year.</p><p>Joanna Salas, Rudy’s wife, said her husband and his brother loved each other, no matter their differences.</p><p>“Steve was and will always be remembered as a very talented, complicated, and rambunctious type of individual,” Joanna Salas said. “He didn’t go by the rules and lived his life the way he wanted.”</p><p>Steve Salas was married briefly in the mid-1970s and had no children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKukmsOmedKao5qrXZiutr%2FEZqafZZSarrW0jg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./hugh-jackman-movies-stream-netflix-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="5 Great Hugh Jackman Movies To Stream On Netflix Right Now">&larr;
