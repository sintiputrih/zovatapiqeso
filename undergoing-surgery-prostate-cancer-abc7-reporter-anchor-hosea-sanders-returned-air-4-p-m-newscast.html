Sanders said,</p><p>“Every time I had a medical exam I would have that prostate test and it’s just a blood test.”&nbsp;</p><p>But it was just this year he decided to face the reality of having surgery.

This is about letting people know that you’re not alone in whatever you go through, You’ve got to get tested. You’ve got to know and the only way to know is to take that simple blood test. It doesn’t take long.&nbsp;I’m still learning and still healing and trying to figure it all out, So it’s strange to me to hear people say you’re a cancer survivor. I haven’t survived anything yet.
