In an interview with Forbes, he talked about his immigration, he said,</p><p>I left three of my sisters behind, my mom behind. My dad was out here in America and I hadn’t seen him in about five years or so. It was definitely a culture shock, coming out here with a completely different language to speak. I didn’t speak a word of English and it was a weird age where I was finally so comfortable with my friends and [I had to] leave them behind to start a new life. So when I got out here, it was very different but I always had a positive mindset. I always knew that I was coming to a country where opportunity was the equivalent to gold.”</p><p>Growing up, he was a sporty child and loved fitness. When he was four years old, he began doing gymnastics. Before his teens, he was in love with soccer and joined various high-level soccer camps and professional youth teams before 10. After coming to the US, he began taking interest in American football. He studied at Westlake High School, California. In high school, he acted in several plays of his school’s drama program. He was a part of his school’s American football team and competed in California Interscholastic Federation Championships twice.</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sam-Asghari-in-black-attire-during-an-American-football-match.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-78161 class=wp-caption-text>Sam Asghari (in black attire) during an American football match</p><p>He was in the football program of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, but he was removed from the team before his freshman year.

He was living in a two-bedroom LA apartment with two roommates at that time. After quitting American football, he lost control of his diet and gained massive weight. After the realization hit him (of what he was doing with himself and his body), he quit his job at Best Buy and nightclub to focus on his fitness. He said to his general manager at the Gold’s Gym that he wanted to become a personal trainer at the gym and learn about fitness and its aspects. The manager agreed, and Sam signed up for the Gold’s Gym Smart Nutrition course and also taught himself about fitness by watching YouTube videos. <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_4><a href=#>[4]</a></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Physical_Appearance></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Physical_Appearance></span>Physical Appearance<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_5><a href=#>[5]</a></span> <strong>Height</strong><strong>:</strong> 6′ 2″</p><p><strong>Eye Color:</strong> Dark Brown</p><p><strong>Hair Color:</strong> Black</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sam-Asghari-actor.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Family_Ethnicity></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Family_Ethnicity></span>Family & Ethnicity<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sam and his family are from Iran, and they migrated to the United States to have a better life and opportunities. <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_6><a href=#>[6]</a></span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Parents_Siblings></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Parents_Siblings></span><strong>Parents & Siblings</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>His father’s name is Mike Asghari, and his mother’s name is Fatima.

In March 2019, Andrew Wallet resigned as a co-conservator. Britney was then involved in a legal battle with her father to end her conservatorship, which was preventing her from marrying or having children with Sam and having control of her assets. In June 2021, Spears told the court that she wanted to have children with Sam but was unable to do so as she was not allowed to remove an intrauterine device for birth control. In 2021, her father filed papers in the court to end Britney’s conservatorship. Talking about his opinion of her father in an interview, Sam said,<br><p>Now it’s important for people to understand that I have zero respect for someone trying to control our relationship and constantly throwing obstacles our way. In my opinion Jamie is a total dick. I won’t be going into details because I’ve always respected our privacy but at the same time I didn’t come to this country to not be able to express my opinion and freedom.”</p></li></ul><ul><li>Britney Spears married twice before she met Sam. The first time, she married Jason Alexander in Las Vegas in 2004; her marriage with Jason was soon annulled. The second time, she married the American rapper and actor Kevin Federline in 2004. Britney and Kevin divorced in 2007. They share the custody of two children, Preston and Jayden. <img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sam-Asghari-with-Britney-Spears-and-her-sons.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-78179 class=wp-caption-text>Sam Asghari with Britney Spears and her sons</p></li></ul><ul><li>Sam and Britney often work out together in Britney’s home gym.
