Then, in 1974, Barbara got promoted to co-host, making history as the first woman to occupy such a position on an American news program.</p><p>She continued to pave the way for women in broadcasting in 1976 when she joined Harry Reasoner as the first female co-anchor of a network evening news show on ABC Evening News.&nbsp;Barbara also gained fame for Barbara Walters’ 10 Most Fascinating People, an annual ABC broadcast.</p><p>She spoke with every sitting president and first lady of the United States, from Richard Nixon to Barack Obama.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=barbara-walterss-net-worth-in-2022></span>Barbara Walters’s Net Worth In 2022<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Barbara Walters is an American broadcast journalist who has an estimated net worth of&nbsp;<b><strong>$170 million.</strong></b></p><p>She has accumulated a massive fortune from her career in journalism as a reporter and television host.&nbsp;She has served as the host of several television programs, including “20/20,” “The View” which she also founded and produced, and the “ABC Evening News.”</p><p>In 1961, the television personality started working for “The Today Show” as a writer and researcher.&nbsp;In 1974, Barbara got promoted to co-host. The newswoman became the first female co-anchor of a network evening news show in 1976.</p><p>Barbara was also the first female co-host of an American news program. The host departed the program on May 15, 2014, but she sometimes appeared as a guest presenter in 2015.&nbsp;She shared the Daytime Emmy for Best Talk Show Host with “The View” in 2003 and 2009.</p><p>She has interviewed renowned personalities, including Anwar Al Sadat, Boris Yeltsin, Vladimir Putin, Margaret Thatcher, Fidel Castro, and numerous US presidents.</p><p>The reporter is widely known for her interviews with famous people, including Sir Laurence Olivier, Katharine Hepburn, and Michael Jackson.&nbsp;Walters’s 1999 interview with Monica Lewinsky garnered 74 million viewers, making it the second-most-watched interview.</p><p>While the 91-year-old journalist’s millions may be ascribed to a decades-long career, selling her ownership in The View increased Walters’s worth.</p><p>When she resigned in 2014, she reportedly decided to sell up her ownership of the talk show for “tens of millions.” The television host’s net worth now exceeds $170 million.&nbsp;Even while Walters has given some of her wealth to organizations, such as the $15 million she gave to her alma school Sarah Lawrence College in 2015, it hasn’t even scratched the surface of Barbara’s overall net worth.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=barbara-walterss-career-earnings></span>Barbara Walters’s Career Earnings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Barbara Walters might have accumulated a fortune from her career as a renowned journalist and television host.</p><p>It’s reasonable to conclude that Walters gained most of her wealth, either directly or indirectly, via her work as a journalist.&nbsp;After all, Walters’s level of notoriety and talent wouldn’t have been inexpensive. Walters would also have had a lot of time to increase her career earnings and reach the position where she is now.</p><p>When Walters agreed to a five-year deal with ABC in 1976, she became the highest-paid journalist, earning $1 million annually.&nbsp;In addition, it is essential to note that the reporter had achieved enormous success as an author, which may not be unexpected given that she wrote a lot when she first started.</p><p>Barbara expanded a magazine piece she had already written and published it as a book in 1970 to aid those who might use some help polishing their social skills.&nbsp;This book sold hundreds of thousands of copies due to its success. Something that even Walters herself seemed surprised.</p><p>Likewise, Walters also published her autobiography in 2008. Given her notoriety, it’s doubtful that this achievement should have come as a surprise.&nbsp;The newswoman had begun to scale back her workload in 2004, but she quit in 2015 and 2016.</p><p>The reporter left her position as co-host of 20/20 in 2004, although Barbara continued to work part-time for ABC News until 2016, contributing to interviews and special programming.</p><p>On March 7, 2010, Walters said she would stop doing Oscar interviews but continue working for ABC and host The View.&nbsp;In 2015, Walters contributed as the anchor of the Investigation Discovery documentary series American Scandals.</p><p>In 2014 and 2015, the journalist continued to anchor ABC’s 10 Most Fascinating People series.&nbsp;Donald Trump was the subject of Barbara Walters’s final on-air interview with ABC News in December 2015.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=barbara-walterss-achievements></span>Barbara Walters’s Achievements<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Barbara is a renowned journalist and television host who has caused viewers to glue their eyes in front of the television.</p><p>In 1989, Barbara Walters became a member of the Television Hall of Fame. Likewise, the reporter has received several awards and honors throughout her career as a journalist and host. She&nbsp;has received her Wikipedia page where her early life and career stats are displayed for the people.</p><p>She is currently 93 years old. She was born to her parents, Dena and Louis, on September 25, 1929, in Boston, Massachusetts.</p><p>She started her career in journalism in 1951 and later retired in 2016. The reporter achieved remarkable milestones in her life.</p><p>The television host got honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on June 15, 2007. She&nbsp;receives a Women in Film Lucy Award, a Daytime and Prime Time Emmy Award, and a GLAAD Excellence in Media Award.</p><p>Gilda Radner’s “Baba Wawa” imitation of Walters on Saturday Night Live, which featured her peculiar pronunciation with its rounded “R,” is an example of her influence on popular culture.</p><p>Barbara’s name also appears in the New York Times Monday Crossword Puzzle from January 23, 1995.</p><p>She received the Disney Legends award in 2008, granted to people who have made remarkable contributions.</p><p>The New York Women’s Agenda gave Walters the Lifetime Achievement Award the same year.&nbsp;She received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 30th Annual News and Documentary Emmy Awards held at Lincoln Center in New York City on September 21, 2009.</p><p>One can explore Barbara on her Twitter handle under her username @BarbaraJWalters. The host has accumulated over 1.4 million followers and uploaded 544 total tweets.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJqRp6%2BivsBmrpqkpJq%2FtHnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5xLGnpaeimrFutMSrnKxlmKTEbr%2FHnmSapZGowKawjKGcq2Wdnrmttc6nqmg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./britney-spears-dances-without-a-soundtrack-while-baring-her-breasts-in-a-low-cut-yellow-dress-530057.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Britney Spears Dances Without A Soundtrack While Baring Her Breasts In A Low-Cut Yellow Dress">&larr;
