Cher then revived her music career with the rock-inflected albums Cher (1987), Heart of Stone (1989), and Love Hurts (1991), which yielded successful singles such as “I Found Someone”, “If I Could Turn Back Time”, and “Love and Understanding”.</p><p>She reached a new commercial peak in 1998 with the dance-pop album Believe, whose title track topped the Billboard Year-End Hot 100 chart of 1999 and became the biggest-selling single of all time by a female artist in the UK. It features pioneering use of Auto-Tune to distort her vocals, known as the “Cher effect”.

During the 2010s, she landed starring roles in the films Burlesque (2010) and Mamma Mia!
