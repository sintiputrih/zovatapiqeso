But according to Glamour, the actress revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she nearly did lose some roles because she was considered too large for them.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Fun fact,” the actress tweeted back in 2014. “I almost lost out on several roles in my career because I was overweight. Wrong, America.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Real Reason Amanda Seyfried And Justin Long Ended Their Relationship</a></span></p><p>In 2010, Amanda elaborated, specifically listing one film in particular that she would have missed out on because of her weight.</p><p>“If I'd been a bit bigger, I don't think they would have cast me for Mamma Mia!" she said in her interview (via Glamour).</p><h2 id=the-lifestyle-hollywood-demands-of-amanda-seyfried>The Lifestyle Hollywood Demands Of Amanda Seyfried</h2><p>In the same interview, Amanda revealed that she has to follow a very strict diet and healthy lifestyle in order to remain at a size that Hollywood deems worthy.</p><p>“If I didn't run and work out, there's no way I would be this thin,” the actress explained. “But I have to stay in shape because I'm an actress. It's f----- up and it's twisted, but I wouldn't get the roles otherwise.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Is Actress Amanda Seyfried Worth?</a></span></p><p>According to Best Fit, the Million Ways to Die in the West actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">follows a strict eating plan, but not a restrictive one</a>.
