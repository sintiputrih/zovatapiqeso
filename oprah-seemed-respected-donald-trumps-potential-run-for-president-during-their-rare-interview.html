Ripa revealed alongside Seth Meyers, “You know what’s crazy, he was talking about running for president then. Then! And I remember actively having this conversation with him. He said, ‘Everybody wants me to run for president,’ and I said, ‘Who."Ripa would go on to reveal that she tried talking <strong><a href=#>Donald Trump</a></strong> out of it - but of course, years later it was clear he did not take that advice. His potential political aspirations started even before his convo with Ripa. Given a past interview with <strong><a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a></strong> during the '80s, it seems evident Trump had a major interest for politics. We'll take a look back at his conversation with Oprah, and how the two once had a mutual respect for one another before their relationship soured.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=oprah-winfrey-once-wrote-a-letter-to-donald-trump-supporting-his-political-career-in-the-early-2000s>Oprah Winfrey Once Wrote A Letter To Donald Trump Supporting His Political Career In The Early 2000s</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar49334701.jpg><p>Former President Donald Trump plans to release a book which will also include private letters from higher ups he bonded with along the way. Among those people includes Oprah, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who had actually endorsed a possible political run with Donald</a>. She wrote in the note, "Too bad we're not running for office."</p><p>Oprah did respond to the reveal of the note, downplaying it and claiming that she was just trying to supportive at the time. Writing a note was a norm for Oprah.</p><p>"And when I heard that this letter is now going to be a part of a book, I thought, 'Oh, wasn't that nice of me to write a note.' That's what I thought, because I'm always like, 'Oh, I should write a note. The person did this, or I should write a note,'" she said.

I might have thought it 23 years ago.

Trump didn't think the country was taking advantage of the situation.</p><p>Oprah would then as Donald if he had interest in possibly running for President? Trump said he wasn't at the time given that he was into what he was doing, but did not like the way the country was being handled.

Trump would take to Twitter and question some of Oprah's tactics.</p><p>He tweeted out, "Just watched a very insecure Oprah Winfrey, who at one point I knew very well, interview a panel of people on 60 Minutes. The questions were biased and slanted, the facts incorrect.
