The detective is struggling with the loss of his partner and began having a secret affair with Jet as a way to cope. A the end of the sixth episode, he announced his decision to take a leave of absence from the task force. <a href=# rel=noopener>Is Bobby Reyes leaving Law & Order: Organized Crime for good</a>? We have the answer below.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Law & Order: Organized Crime</a>&nbsp;is the sixth spin-off in the&nbsp;Law & Order franchise. It follows Detective Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni) as he returns to the NYPD to battle organized crime after his wife’s murder. The series first premiered in 2021 and is currently on its fourth season. Rounding out the cast is Rick Gonzalez as Detective Bobby Reyes, Danielle Moné Truitt as Sargeant Ayanna Bell and Ainsley Seiger as Detective Jet Slootmaekers.</p><p>In the Season 3 finale, Detective Jamie Whelan (Brent Antonello), Reyes’ partner, was tragically killed off. Season 4 picked back up in January 2024 and showed the team mourning his death. Reyes and Jet, the latter of whom was romantically involved with Whelan, were having a particularly difficult time and leaned on each other for support, resulting in the pair beginning a secret affair despite the fact that Reyes is married with kids.</p><p>Their affair came to a head in the sixth episode, and Reyes revealed that he was taking a leave of absence from work. After the death of Whelan, fans fear that they may be losing another member of the Organized Crime family.

The answer is no. Reyes will be taking some time off and won’t appear in tonight’s episode, but he will return, as <a href=# rel=noopener>TVLine</a> confirmed. “You can rest assured that Gonzalez’s Reyes&nbsp;is still with the team,” the outlet reported.</p><p>In the last few minutes of Episode 6, Jet finds Reyes packing his bags. After he informs her that he is divorcing his wife and taking a leave of absence, she asks: “Is this because of us?” Reyes responds, “No, this is because of me. Tammy and I haven’t been good for a while, and when Jamie died, I went off the rails.” He continues: “I signed the divorce papers this morning. It’s been unofficial for months. But now it’s real. And my kids, they don’t get it. I need to be with them. And try to put myself back together while I’m at it.” Jet asks him if there’s anything she can do to help, to which Reyes responds: “I could use a friend when I get back.”</p><p>The pair’s secret affair began shortly after Whelan died. While speaking to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TV Insider</a> ahead of the Season 4 premiere, Ainsley Seiger, who stars as Jet, explained what led the two characters down this messy path. “A lot of what Rick and I have talked about — because we’ve had so many really extensive conversations about it — is that grief is a funny thing and it makes you do really weird, crazy stuff,” she said. “And I think to go from this trio of friends to suddenly a very lonely duo is jarring and odd and really uncomfortable.”</p><p>“I think there’s a lot to be said for the way that a relationship can deepen and develop when the context changes and especially when you’re seeking out someone who knows what you’ve been through, who you don’t have to talk to about it because they already get it,” she continued, adding: “I don’t think it’s as healing as either of them think that it may be.”</p><p>While fans are going to miss Reyes in tonight’s episode, there will still be plenty of action to look forward to. Per the episode’s logline, the squad will back up Stabler in pursuing a murder case outside of their jurisdiction and an unlikely ally will provide a key piece of evidence. Meanwhile, Bell works to find a way to get Stabler back on the job. There will also be <a href=# rel=noopener>surprise cameo</a> from Law & Order: SVU&nbsp;mainstay Captain Cragen (played by Dann Florek).</p><p>It’s still unclear when Reyes will return, but it will likely be very soon as Season 4 has a reduced episode count of 13 total episodes.</p><p>Law & Order: Organized Crime airs on NBC on Thursdays at 10 pm EST and streams on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Peacock</a>.</p><p><strong>For more on Law & Order, check out this gallery on the <a href=# rel=noopener>franchise stars’ real-life partners</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvYmaFc4SOq5yynaNiuaat1aKloGWfp7SiusiznJ1lk6e2rrGO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./crissa-jacksons-wife-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Crissa Jackson Dating  Crissa Jackson's Wife &amp;amp; Exes">&larr;
