This summer, both pop stars (Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, Drake) and legends (Madonna, Bruce Springsteen, Dead & Company) are hitting the road for the first time in years — as are dozens of other acts, from country to K-pop to hip-hop.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clhrzb6h4000l3b6vm10jmzko@published data-word-count=100>Yet it’s also never been harder to buy concert tickets, due to increased demand and failures of the platforms that sell them. After a catastrophic sale for her Eras tour, involving misallocated presale codes, long queues, and platform malfunctions, Swift <a href=#>sympathized with fans</a> who felt “like they went through several bear attacks” to attend the show. So not only have we compiled the biggest North American tours of the summer — we’ve also rated them on a scale of 0 to 5 of how many bear attacks you’ll feel like you went through to attend.
