His Mom’s name is Francesca Costa. Recently, Zaniolo was forced to remind his mom of her age following a string of sexy selfies she posted on Instagram.</p><p>The 21-year-old was a breakout star last season in his maiden campaign with Roma and as he gained more attention he urged his mother to keep a lower profile after she uploaded one too many duck faces. “Stop mum,” he commented on one photo. “What are you doing with your mouth like that? You’re 40!”</p><p>Opposition fans had now started directing sexist chants at her during matches — but Costa is taking it all in stride. She said “it is better to be envied than to be pitied” after Parma supporters sang “la mamma di Zaniolo e Una puttana”, which translates to “Zaniolo’s mother is a w****” during Roma’s 2-0 defeat.</p><p>Shortly after the match, Costa took to social media to respond. “To the sexist chants, we answer with a smile. Always,” she wrote. “It is better to be envied than pitied. Thank you, love. Explain to them that we laugh about this”.</p><p>She also thanked Roma’s fans for their support. “I want to thank the Roma fans for your thousands and thousands of messages showing support for Nicolo and the entire family. Your affection is truly touching and incredible,” Costa wrote.</p><p>“Furthermore, I want to thank the Napoli fans that have taken the time to write two or more words despite the disappointing result, showing their love for Nicolo writing the most beautiful and genuine things, something football does not always show. This football can only be loved. Thank you again for your sportsmanship!”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=nicolo-zaniolo-girlfriend-who-is-nicolo-zaniolo-dating></span><span>Nicolò Zaniolo Girlfriend: Who Is Nicolò Zaniolo Dating?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Zaniolo is currently in a relationship with Italian model Sara Scaperrotta.
