From then on, he had a reputation for being an unapologetically foul-mouthed comedian. He was not shy to use any of the seven words he listed in his stand-up act and he covered a variety of raunchy topics.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Reason Why George Carlin's Comedy Is Still So Important Today</a></span></p><p>He also played Mr. Conductor in Shining Time Station, one of the most popular children's show's to air on PBS. He is far from being the only vulgar comic to take on such an uncharacteristic role. Bob Saget swore like a sailor and played a squeaky clean sitcom dad. Sinbad was on Nickelodeon shows. And a rock star who sings about sex and heroin did a few voices for Nickelodeon cartoons as well. These stars have done children's shows and family programming, but they are all famous for some vulgar material too.</p><h2 id=george-carlin-was-on-shining-time-station><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>George Carlin Was On Shining Time Station</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As mentioned above, the comedian famous for his "Seven Words You Can't Say On Television" bit played Mr. Conductor on the children's program about the adventures that go on with trains. The show was also the American launching pad for Thomas The Tank Engine which was originally a U.K. show. Carlin was the replacement for the original Mr. Conductor, Ringo Starr.</p><h2 id=bob-saget-cleaned-up-his-act-when-on-full-house><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Bob Saget Cleaned Up His Act When On Full House</span></h2><p>Saget's stand-up comedy and his character on the hit '90s sitcom were polar opposites. Danny Tanner was the Mr. Clean of the family, both literally and figuratively. In addition to being the clean-cut dad, his character was also a total neat freak. Out of character, Bob Saget <a href=#>was a lewd and crude comedian</a> who joked about sex and drugs constantly. In his stand-up he would do bits where he would reveal behind-the-scenes secrets about Full House, like how he would cuss his head off in between takes to get the swearing that came so naturally to him out of his system.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Did Bob Saget Go On 'The Masked Singer'?</a></span></p><h2 id=sinbad-was-in-a-nickelodeon-movie><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Sinbad Was In A Nickelodeon Movie</span></h2><p>Sinbad has numerous bits about sex, marriage, and drugs, and is not afraid to drop his share of f-bombs. But, he was good at reading his audiences. When performing on network shows he never swore in his routine, and he managed to keep it clean whenever he did work for Nickelodeon. He did cameos in a handful of Nick shows, most famously on All That. He was also <a href=#>a co-star in the Nickelodeon movie Good Burger</a> which was based on the popular All That skit.</p><h2 id=ice-cube-had-to-keep-it-clean-on-all-that><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Ice Cube Had To Keep It Clean On All That</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A cornerstone of All That's popularity was its musical guests. The show often invited hip-hop artists to perform, provided they did clean versions of their songs. Many hardcore stars performed on the show, one could probably write a book on each one, but one of the most surprising guests was Ice Cube. Cube had just parted ways with his band NWA, which is just an abbreviation for a group name that uses the N-word. But as if that wasn't enough one of Cube's hit songs at the time was "No Vaseline" his diss track against his former bandmates that features numerous references to sex, as well as countless swear words.</p><h2 id=ray-j-the-guy-from-kim-k-39-s-sex-tape-was-on-all-that><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Ray J, The Guy From Kim K's Sex Tape, Was On All That</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ray J has numerous songs that are far too explicit for children. Yet he was still one of the many hip-hop stars to stop by and perform on All That. Ray J would however get in trouble for his lyrics several years later. Some fans were not happy in 2014 when he was seen on video playing incredibly lewd songs in front of <a href=#>his four-month-old child</a>. Ray J would also become the center of one of the internet's biggest sex scandals, he was in Kim Kardashian's notorious sex tape.</p><h2 id=ben-schwartz-is-a-voice-on-duck-tales><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Ben Schwartz Is A Voice On Duck Tales</span></h2><p>Schwartz toned down his cursing for the reboot of the Disney cartoon <a href=#>Duck Tales to join the cast as Dewey</a>. Schwartz is not the most vulgar of comedians but he did do several videos for CollegeHumor with his friends Jake Horowitz and Amir Blumenfeld where he cusses like crazy, wears a BangBros t-shirt, and tells plenty of NSFW jokes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jake And Amir: Where Are They Now?</a></span></p><h2 id=flea-was-in-an-iconic-nickelodeon-show><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Flea Was In An Iconic Nickelodeon Show</span></h2><p>Flea is the bassist for The Red Hot Chili Peppers, a band made famous for performing in their underwear (onetime Flea wore nothing but a sock) and for lyrics about sex, drugs, addiction, and even death. But, he is also a gifted voice actor and was a cast member in one of Nickelodeon's most iconic cartoons. He was the voice of Donny, the feral child, in The Wild Thornberrys. Flea is also the voice of The Milk Thief on Sheriff Callie's Wild West, a show on Disney Jr.</p><h2 id=sharon-osbourne-does-a-disney-show><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Sharon Osbourne Does A Disney Show</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anyone familiar with the MTV reality hit The Osbournes knows that Ozzy and the fam are incredibly, famously, foul-mouthed. Fans heard bleeps of practically every other word anytime one spoke. Even when the show ended, Sharon has not been shy about dropping an F-bomb casually, as she did in an interview with Conan when promoting her show The Talk on Conan. Still, none of this deterred producers from casting her as Mama Hook in Jake and the Neverland Pirates, a cartoon show on Disney Jr.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:<a href=#> People Forget These A-Listers Were On Community</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGienqeinLJur8Cro6KmXZa7pXmWZqatoJWnerfBy6CYq2Wjqa6zv4ywn6hllJ6xbq%2FHoqOdqpWjwG6tzZ1kn5mdnrm6edKhprCrXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kesley-leroy-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kesley LeRoy Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; Biography">&larr;
