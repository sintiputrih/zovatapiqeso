The couples must marry before their visas expire in 90 days, or the visiting partner will have to return home.” Indeed, the premise seems shocking and almost impossible. But some couples do find love this way. Unfortunately,&nbsp;not everyone gets a happily ever after and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">many of the couples do break up</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show has been on air&nbsp;since 2014 and&nbsp;it's no surprise that the couples featured on the&nbsp;series have grown somewhat of a&nbsp;fanbase. From keeping up with their social media accounts to wondering&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">if the cast gets paid to be on the show</a>, the world just loves 90 Day Fiance.</p><p>While&nbsp;following these couples' journey to the altar is extremely&nbsp;interesting and entertaining,&nbsp;people also often <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wonder if some&nbsp;moments on the show are staged for the cameras</a>. In the spirit of getting to the bottom of what goes on behind the scenes of 90 Day Fiance, we've collected various facts in order to discover what is in fact real and what is fake or exaggerated.</p><h2 id=fake-the-tinder-scandal-involving-jay-smith><span class=item-num>23 </span><span>Fake: The Tinder Scandal Involving Jay Smith</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jay-Smith-and-Ashley-Martson-from-90-Day-Fiance-in-an-interview.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jay&nbsp;Smith revealed during an interview&nbsp;with In Touch Weekly that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Tinder Incident that happened was staged</a> for the cameras.

Instead, he was simply after building up his portfolio. As it turns out, Mack is an aspiring actor. And on a casting call website called Explore Talent, Mack used to have a profile page. According to Distractify, he had listed himself as an “actor and model based in Raleigh.”</p><h2 id=fake-tom-brooks-luxurious-lifestyle><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Fake: Tom Brooks' Luxurious Lifestyle</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tom-Brook’s-luxurious-lifestyle-via-bustle.com_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems that Tom Brooks has gotten into the habit of stealing high-luxury lifestyle photos on social media and passing them as his own. Such photos included one of a Louis Vuitton box and Moet champagne being enjoyed poolside. Following his fake posts, Brooks was called out by some of the photos’ original owners. According to Soap Dirt, Brooks attempted to defend his actions by saying they were “paid promotions.”</p><h2 id=real-only-american-cast-members-get-paid><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Real: Only American Cast Members Get Paid</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Only-American-cast-members-get-paid-via-screenrant.com_.jpg><p>On the show, it is only the American cast members who get to receive a salary for their appearances, according to E!

According to a copy of the complaint available on Justia US Law, the couple alleged that they were “fraudulently misrepresented on the show.” They also claimed that the show’s producers provided “false verbal explanations and promises” and that “they only signed the release and agreements in reliance on such misrepresentations.” In the end, however, the lawsuit was dismissed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=real-women-are-asked-to-sit-a-certain-way-to-enhance-physical-appeal><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Real: Women Are&nbsp;Asked&nbsp;To Sit A Certain Way To Enhance Physical Appeal</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Anfisa-Archipenchko-of-90-Day-Fiance-during-interview.png><p>During sit-down individual interviews, it does sometimes appear that the women are under a great deal of discomfort.

However, Villegas told her fans on IG Live, “People complain about me not picking him up at the airport, [but] Corey is a great actor. That's all I'm going to say about that.

However, it was the possession of this substance that later led to his arrest. According to a report from Radar Online, police had found as many as 293 pounds of “high-grade” substances in his car. He was then charged for transportation of the substance for sale, possession for sale, possession, and possession of related paraphernalia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=real-in-the-beginning-no-network-wanted-the-show><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Real: In The Beginning, No Network Wanted The Show</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/In-the-beginning-no-network-wanted-the-show-via-youtube.com-TLC-channel.jpg><p>While speaking on the Reality Life podcast with Kate Casey, the show’s executive producer, Matt Sharp said that the initial pitch for the show involves following men who are looking to find love in other countries. However, the pitch fell flat with the networks and his team had to return to the drawing board. This was when they zeroed in on the idea of centering the storylines around the 90-day K-1 visa time period.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Asuelu From 90 Day Fiancé: 15 Surprising Facts</a></span></p><h2 id=fake-caesar-mack-being-single><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Fake: Caesar Mack Being Single</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Caesar-Mack-being-single-via-soapdirt.com_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to reports, it seems that Caesar Mack wasn’t even single when he supposedly became interested to start a life with Maria.

But, they pay more for the 'Tell All,' pay for travel and stuff for a lot of shots and he wants to get into doing commercial work, so he took this as an ACTING job.

In short, the show is not responsible for securing the visa. They’re more interested to film the drama that goes on long after you got the visa and you’re thinking of pursuing a relationship with someone in the U.S.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fake-caesar-and-maria-s-relationship><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Fake: Caesar And Maria’s Relationship</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/90-Day-Fiance-Caesar-and-Maria.jpg><p>The other bombshell surrounding this 90 Day Fiancé couple is the allegation that the two never really had a relationship from the beginning. One Reddit thread stated, “Their relationship was ending before the show even started- and she wasn’t [sic] interested in being on camera, which was the nail in the coffin.” The thread also added, “He says ALL the drama in their relationship was made up by producers.

We're trying to obviously do the right thing. We try to be open-minded...everyone's got some sort of history.” Well said. In fact, we’d like to point out that some cast members do have a criminal history.
