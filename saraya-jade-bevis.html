Additionally, she has a brother named Roy Bevis and half-brother Zak Zodiac are professional wrestlers.</p><p>Paige did not want to pursue a career in wrestling at a young age because she feared the injuries her family suffered.

In the beginning stage, she did not get a great deal of success, yet she continued to wrestle.</p><p>From the year 2009 onwards, Paige was able to achieve a single victory in her career.
