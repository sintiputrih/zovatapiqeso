Today Hill is mostly known for his appearances in such movies as “Knocked Up”, “Get Him to the Greek”, “Superbad”, “Funny People”, “21 Jumps Street” and “Moneyball”. Furthermore, he made an amazing addition to his net worth after creating the nimated TV series entitled “Allen Gregory” which aired on Fox up to December 18, 2011. However, these series received many negative reviews and were officially cancelled.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=jonah-hill-net-worth-30-million></span>Jonah Hill Net Worth $30 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Jonah Hill Feldstein was born on December 20, 1983, in Los Angeles, California, United States. We was raised in a Jewish family: mother Sharon Lyn is a costume designer and fashion stylist, while his father Richard Feldstein is known as a tour accountant for the famous rock band Guns N’ Roses. Hill attended The Center for Early Education before school and then studied in two different schools in Santa Monica. After graduation he attended Bard College, and he was also a student of The New School, which specializes in music and sports.</p><p>At about that time Jonah started his career as a comedian. Hill was trying to increase his net worth while performing plays in bars, and though he didn’t earn very much, it helped him to create a small group of fans, and that was the first step in his future career. Of course, then no one could know how rich Jonah Hill was going to be after a few more years.</p><p>During his career as an actor, J. Hill’s net worth increased amazingly. He has appeared in 35 different films and 12 TV series. His first appearance in a movie was in 2004, when he had a role in a film called “I Heart Huckabees”, also known as “I Love Huckabees” directed by David O. Russell. Then he played an eBay customer one year later in “The 40 Year Old Virgin” directed by Judd Apatow.</p><p>Nowadays Jonah Hill is still active as an actor and continues building up his net worth. In 2013 he filmed two movies – “This Is the End” where he played himself and “The Wolf of Wall Street” as Donnie Azoff. In 2014 he has already appeared in four different movies, and one more (“True Story” directed by Rupert Goold) will be released this year. J. Hill is also going to be a voice actor in the “Sausage Party” which is being filmed right now, in 2014, and it is going to appear on screen in 2016. He also is an executive producer of “Sausage party”. So there is no wonder that Johan Hill’s net worth continues to rise.</p><p>During his career Jonah Hill has been nominated for numerous awards, but won only three times. His first award Hill received in 2011 – it was Palm Springs International Film Festival Award for Creative Impact in Acting Award for his role in “Moneyball”, and in 2013 he won two more awards for his performance in “The Wolf of Wall Street”.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$30 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>December 20, 1983</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Los Angeles, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 6 in (1.7 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Comedian, Film Producer, Screenwriter, Voice Actor, Writer</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Sharon Lyn Chalkin, Richard Feldstein</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Jordan Feldstein, Beanie Feldstein</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Jonah Hill Feldstein</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>http://www.facebook.com/JonahHill</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td>http://www.twitter.com/jonahhill</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>, Sausage Party, Arms and the Dudes</td></tr></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1frLWwecisZKOnnpa1brTIpaNmq5Waeq%2Bx02auqKqknXqywc6tnGaZp5a%2Fpb%2BMn5icrF2stqy1jg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./why-did-jedediah-bila-leave-fox-news.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Did Jedediah Bila Leave Fox News?
