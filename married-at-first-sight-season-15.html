But as the season winds down, viewers can't help but wonder when Married at First Sight Season 15 premieres. Or, more importantly, if there's a <a href=#>Season 15</a> at all.</p><p>Married at First Sight is one of those Lifetime reality shows that has been on so long there's usually no question about its lifespan on the network. There are even specials that air before and during the series that show how much Married at First Sight content fans want.</p><p>Which, spoiler alert, is a lot. But what does the future hold after Season 14?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Lifetime</span><p>Michael and Jasmina from Season 14 of 'Married at First Sight.'</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When is 'Married at First Sight' Season 15?</h2><p>The application for Season 15 of Married at First Sight, which was removed and replaced by the Season 16 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nashville</a> season application, previously listed the filming dates.</p><p>At the time, the application said filming would begin in late January 2022. According to a press release obtained by Distractify, Season 15 of Married at First Sight premieres on July 6, 2022.</p><p>Not only that, but there will be a three-hour premiere special, which starts at 8 p.m. EST on Lifetime.</p><p>According to the press release, "The show heads to the sunny West Coast for the first time ever. Singles from San Diego, California will meet their matches for a brand-new season, destined to be entertaining, surprising and full of romance."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where was 'Married at First Sight' Season 15 filmed?</h2><p>Married at First Sight Season 15 was filmed in San Diego, Calif. This marks the first West Coast season and, at the time of filming, viewers shared alleged updates on reddit to keep other fans up to date on the couples to expect in the summer 2022 season.</p><p>In March 2022, one <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor</a> shared that they believed their fiancé saw a film crew in the area.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I petition that Season 15 of <a href=#>#MAFS</a> is for all past spouses that were royally screwed over but are still looking for love. Chris, Gil, Paige, Kate, Mindy, etc. <a href=#>#MarriedAtFirstSight</a> Australia gave someone a second chance and I think it’s time for America to do the same. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/C0rcCgeeef</a></p>— HyriomSky (@hyriom) <a href=#>January 28, 2022</a></figure><p>If Season 15 began filming in January 2022, then the cast was likely still shooting in San Diego in March. Clearly, fans were already pumped for a new season before Season 14's reunion is even over.</p><p>Season 15 of MAFS also features two new experts to help the couples through their journey. DeVon Franklin, a Hollywood producer, New York Times bestselling author, and relationship advisor is one of the new additions.</p><p>And Dr. Pia Holec, a psychotherapist who specializes in sex and couples' therapy, also joins the panel of experts for Season 15.</p><p>But before the Season 15 premiere, fans can watch the Season 15 Matchmaking Special on June 22, 2022 at 8 p.m. EST on Lifetime.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Season 16 of 'Married at First Sight' is also all but certain.</h2><p>Even though Married at First Sight Season 15 hasn't even premiered yet, there's a good chance we're getting Season 16 afterward. The casting website, which previously featured the application for San Diego, now features a new one for Nashville. And as long as Season 16 happens, it will likely premiere in January 2023.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Lifetime</span><p>'Married at First Sight' is expected to film in Nashville for Season 16.</p></figure><p>Despite there being more Married at First Sight <a href=#>divorces</a> than successful marriages, people keep signing up for the show. One thing Married at First Sight fans can count on is that they'll get a new batch of dramatic couples around the same time twice each year.</p><p>And right now, literally no one is complaining about that.</p><p>Watch Married at First Sight on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EST on Lifetime.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6zvsiem2aZpGKzqr7SrWSsoZedwW6%2FxJqqqKZdZoI%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./acting-my-wage-embittered-employee-has-everyone-admitting-the-funniest-times-theyve-stolen-company-time.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Acting my wage: Embittered employee has everyone admitting the funniest times theyve stolen">&larr;
