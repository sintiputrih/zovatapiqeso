The pair began dating in 2016 after meeting on Tinder, as they confirmed in March 2018.&nbsp;On March 20, 2019, Adams’s partner stated that he had proposed to his lover on bended knee. They are now ready to take the next step three years after their engagement. On March 27, 2022, Adams posted a video on his YouTube account titled ‘Having a Baby *The First Step*.’&nbsp;The pair disclosed that they were making strides toward becoming kids.</p><h2>Starting a Family with Ryland Adams and Shane Dawson</h2><p>They considered all of their options, including surrogacy and adoption. “Today, I began hunkering down and attempting to make progress. The terrible part is that we are not ladies, thus we must locate a donor. Shane then began reading it and became depressed “Ryland said. His spouse noted that scrolling through the list of donors was “depressing” since it reminded them that they couldn’t do it themselves.</p><p>Previously, Adams disclosed on an episode of his podcast, The Sip, that the waitlist was 18 to 36 months if they began immediately, even with a surrogacy service. They did, however, mention in their YouTube video that they had selected an egg donor.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ryland-Adams-2.jpg alt="Ryland Adams" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Later in the video, he and his girlfriend discussed their baby plans, including whether they would raise their child over the internet. Dawson said that he would keep his kid out of the spotlight because he did not want the public’s hatred for him to be transferred to their child. He stated that people despised him too much for him to chance people despising their child.</p><h2>Shane Dawson Took a Break Following the Drama</h2><p>We can’t say how much or how many people despise Dawson, but he was forced to leave the internet in 2020 after receiving a deluge of abuse.&nbsp;Dramageddon 2.0, starring Dawson, Jeffree Star, Tati Westbrook, and James Charles, shook the beauty industry in 2020. Westbrook made a video in which he accused Charles of being a sexual predator, forcing him to lose millions of members and affiliate partnerships overnight.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ryland-Adams-3.jpg alt="Ryland Adams" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>This fueled speculation that Dawson and Star staged Westbrook’s video, which he rejected.&nbsp;However, Westbrook uploaded a second video in which he claimed Dawson and Star had duped her into sharing the original video, which sparked a conflict with Charles.&nbsp;This resulted in a large number of Dawson cancellations, which led to people bringing out recordings from his early years on YouTube in which he participated in grossly improper conduct.</p><p>His previous work included racist sketches, such as the use of blackface and the N-word, as well as obscene jokes about pedophilia and animals. There was also an old video of him pretending to masturbate to Willow Smith, who was 11 at the time.&nbsp;Dawson subsequently apologized in a video titled “Taking Accountability” and stepped away from social media. He has already returned to YouTube but has been quiet so far.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGipsqSRo7FurcOapKxlo6mus8DIp55mmV2jsrh5yaisq6aVrnq4tdOhZKygkaOybrDAsKqopl8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./amber-ridinger-wedding-diamond-tiara.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The details behind socialite Amber Ridinger's $16 million bridal tiara">&larr;
