While the post undoubtedly helped some people off their cringey comedy crutches back when it first went viral, the ensuing years have spawned a host of new unfunny bromides in need of a moratorium. Despite <a href=#>predictions to the contrary</a>, there’s a strong case to be made that humor has only <a href=#>gotten worse during the Trump era</a>, so with the clean slate of a new decade before us, the moment could not be more opportune to nip some of these new hacky habits in the bud.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck5o6pqkn00143h677i4ejsxg@published data-word-count=92>Of course, comedy is still subjective. Audience tastes evolve over time. Senses of humor vary wildly from person to person and community to community. Caveats aside, we still need to select some comedic arbiters for an endeavor like determining which hack jokes, washed memes, and otherwise stale bits need to be left in the 2010s. Since the Workaholics writers’ room is no more, we instead decided to pitch this question to a bunch of the <a href=#>up-and-coming professionally funny people</a> who will likely be shaping comedy for (at least) the next few years.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck5o6r429001b3h673cy13zhc@published data-word-count=132><a href=#><strong>Demi Adejuyigbe</strong></a><strong>:</strong> I hope that we finally retire any variation of the terrible “gun = dick” jokes in any action film. All the “Is that a gun in your pocket?” or “My gun’s bigger” shit is so hacky and Freudian in a way that always makes me feel embarrassed for the writers. Also, any joke where the whole “gag” is that a grown man likes something that is typically for women, or a violent/intense action sequence set to a feminine song. It’s such a cheap laugh, and the punch line is always “How embarrassing to actually like a woman’s thing!” Oh, and if I hear the phrase “That’s gonna leave a mark” in a movie again, I am going to sue.

The details of it can be anything; it’s usually weird for the sake of weird because it’s out of context and it’s not funny since you can really put any detail there and it will just feel like the same exact joke. “… So she says to me, ‘What do you mean you’re out of Diet Pepsi?!’” “… And let’s just say that’s one Boston Market I’m not welcome to anymore!” “… And then I said, ‘Paul McCartney, you are one epic son of a bitch.’” You can literally say whatever and it will always be not that good.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck5o708nz002u3h67igvtgh4t@published data-word-count=37><a href=#><strong>Mohanad Elshieky</strong></a><strong>: </strong>When a comedian keeps a joke in their act that never gets laughs, and follows it up with “This one is just for me.” Why are you telling it to a roomful of people then?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck5o71nso00333h67rvia6lcx@published data-word-count=131><a href=#><strong>Brad Evans</strong></a><strong>: </strong>I’m tired of that thing people say, “Liking X is not a personality.” As in “Liking The Office is not a personality” or “Carter mistakes having a dog for a personality.” Whose personality is so amazing and multifaceted that they feel they can just sum people up and dismiss their whole being like this? It feels like such an arrogant thing to say when maybe the person saying it isn’t that different from or more nuanced than the rest of us. Each one of us is just a different bumbling accumulation of neuroses we’ve developed from childhood or adulthood babbling about the three things we’re interested in trying our best to get by.
