He seems shifty and is notoriously a liar and a backstabber. <b>Players should side with Jack Matt if they are looking for someone honest and looking out for the well-being of others, and not just themselves.</b></span></span> <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on sportskeeda.com</a><h2>What happens if you help Juan instead of Matt?</h2>If you side with Juan, you'll get a unique mission to track down a contract and secure a bug that you can use to spy on Matt and can use in a later mission. Ultimately, neither choice interrupts your actual mission to find your sister and you'll reach a similar conclusion. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on pcgamer.com</a><h2>Should I help Jack Matt or Juan?</h2>Should You Side With Jack Matt or Juan in Dying Light 2?

He's arrogant and seems to only have his best interest at heart, especially when he makes you go retrieve the UV Lamps he was supposed to procure. Jack Matt, on the other hand, seems to be one of the good guys. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on upcomer.com</a><h2>Dying Light 2 - Should You Help Jack Matt or Juan?

Although this is never explicitly shown, she will kiss Aiden on the cheek if she is officially made a Nightrunner (assuming she did not kill Hakon in the Nightrunners quest). <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on dyinglight.fandom.com</a><h2>Do I help Juan discover the truth?</h2>Choosing to help Juan discover the truth, will instead see you skip the Observatory with Veronika, and you will head directly toward the dam and the Colonel.
