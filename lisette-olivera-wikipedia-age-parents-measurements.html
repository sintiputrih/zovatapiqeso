So, as the new protagonist, the series focused on the character “Jess Valenzuela”— portrayed by Lisette Olivera.</span></p><p><span>Haven’t heard of the actress? Keep reading this Lisette Olivera Wikipedia to learn all about her.</span></p><h3><b>Lisette Olivera On National Treasure: Edge Of History</b></h3><p><span>Lisette Olivera plays “Jess Valenzuela” on </span><i><span>National Treasure: Edge of History</span></i><span>. Her character, Jess is a Mexican-American DREAMer who was grieving her mother’s death after she received a clue about a centuries-old treasure in the form of a family heirloom necklace.</span></p><p><span>However, Jess wasn’t the only one interested in locking the secrets of her past. There was a black-market antiquities dealer Billie (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who was in search of the prize as well.</span></p><p><span>On the show, Jess’s dad gets killed as well in an attempt to prevent thieves from finding the location of an Aztec Empire relic. He was double-crossed by a mysterious boss — which was also the main reason why her mother fled to the US from Mexico!</span></p><p><span>Promoting the show, Lisette took to her IG to write, “Grab your torches and let the countdown begin. National Treasure: Edge of History premieres in less than one month. Are you ready for the adventure?”</span></p><p><span>She was both nervous and excited to be the new face of a franchise. And it’s understandable given how closely associated the National Treasure films are with their leading man, Nicolas Cage. Replacing him certainly is no easy feat!</span></p><p><span>In case you’re wondering, Nicolas couldn’t make it to the first season of the show as his schedule got in the way. But worry not for co-showrunner Marianne Wibberley promised to bring him back in an episode if they got a second season.</span></p><p><b>Fun Fact:</b><span> Lisette broke out into tears when a key character faced a tragic death in </span><i><span>National Treasure: Book of Secrets</span></i><span> (season 2). “I was so angry and said to my parents, ‘I can’t believe the writers did that,” she explained.</span></p><h3><b>Lisette Olivera Movies And TV Shows</b></h3><p><span>Lisette Olivera is an up-and-coming actress.

No wonder, the actress was encouraged to pour more of herself into her character in </span><i><span>National TreasureNational Treasure</span></i><span> by the director Mira Nair, a fellow Mexican American citizen</span></p><p><span>“Mira Nair, who directed the first episode, actually kind of gave me the permission to say, ‘Hey, let’s do that detail. Let’s have her touch her necklace or acknowledge the necklace whenever she’s thinking about her family.’ The fact that she can’t hug her mother or her father in a way kind of resembles how she has a tendency to want to touch something so close and personal to her,” Lisette explained.</span></p><h3><b>Who Are Lisette Olivera Parents?</b></h3><p><span>Lisette Olivera was born to parents, Ruben I Gutierrez and Silvia Gutierrez. They turned 51 and 50 years of age respectively in 2022.</span></p><p><span>According to the actress, she had a “really strong connection” with her mother. “I would describe my mother as almost like my heartbeat. She’s my champion, and somebody that has always helped me move forward,” she explained.</span></p><p><span>But it’s not only her mother, Lisette is also close to her dad and her sisters who make her “a better artist because of how they operate in the world and their experiences.”</span></p><p><span>Also, Lisette was close to her maternal grandfather who passed away in October 2020 at the age of 93. He was the one who crossed the border of Mexico with Lisette’s mother on his shoulders. “He was my caretaker because my parents were always working, so to me, he was like a father, only with white-as-snow hair. it complemented his wisdom,” Lisette paid him a tribute on her IG.</span></p><p><b>Fun Fact:</b><span> Lisette acknowledged Catherine Zeta-Jones (who plays black-market-antiquities dealer Billie Pearce) as a mother figure on set. “She was so willing to put me under [her] wing, and I really felt like she was going to take care of me,” she explained.</span></p><h3><b>Lisette Olivera Boyfriend</b></h3><p><span>Lisette Olivera didn’t share her relationship status in 2022.
