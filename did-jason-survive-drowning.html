The lack of oxygen caused severe brain damage, affecting his speech and explaining why Mrs.<h2>How is Jason immortal?</h2>Jason Vorhees isn't your run-of-the-mill biblical demon<p>In the movie, Jason's demonic soul keeps passing from person to person via a grotesque "hell baby" who takes over and destroys his host's body. The hosts don't last long because Jason needs to possess someone from his bloodline to once again become immortal.</p><h2>Why is Jason deformed?</h2>Jason Voorhees' story starts with his deformed face. Voorhees has these severe deformities due to the fact that he was born with hydrocephalus and an abnormally large head, which, as you can imagine, was the bane of his existence growing up. And eventually, he was bullied, thrown in the lake and drowned.<h2>Why is Jason scared of water?</h2>For the majority of the Friday the 13th franchise, Jason had almost no weaknesses.

Throughout the series, he doesn't age and his abilities never falter. This is partly due to his powers of regeneration.<h2>How did Jason get back to Crystal Lake from New York?</h2>2002 – Friday the 13th part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan (1989) Jason is once again resurrected by lightening, rather electricity and after killing two teens on a boat on Crystal Lake, it somehow reaches the ocean.
