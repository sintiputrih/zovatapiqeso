He was an actor, best known to the world for appearing in such films as “The French Connection” (1971), “Jaws” (1975), and “All That Jazz” (1979), among many others. His career began in 1961 and ended in 2008.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Roy Scheider was at the time of his death? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Roy Scheider`s net worth was as high as $15 million, an amount earned through his successful career in the entertainment industry as an actor, during which he appeared in over 80 film and TV titles.</p><h3>Roy Scheider Net Worth $15 Million</h3><p>Roy is of mixed ancestry as his parents are of Irish and German descent. Since the early age, Roy was built athletically, and participated in several sports, including baseball and boxing. While in high school, he was in welterweight category and earned an induction into the Columbia High school Hall Of Fame. After high school he enrolled the Rutgers University and Franklin and Marshall College, where he studied drama.</p><p>Before he started his acting career, Roy dedicated himself to boxing, compiling a record of 13 wins and only one lost match. He also spent three years in the United States Army Force, but upon return he became a full time actor.</p><p>His debut came in the early 1960s in the soap operas “Love of Life”, “The Edge Of Night”, and “The Secret Storm”. In 1964 he featured in his first full length film “The Curse of the Living Corpse”, a horror directed by Del Tenney. By the end of the 1960s, Roy built a name for himself by appearing in such productions as “Lamp at Midnight” (1966), “Hidden Faces” (1968), and “Stiletto” (1969), among others, all of which certainly increased his net worth.</p><p>With the beginning of the 1970s, his name became more known in the Hollywood area and in the early 1970 he featured in two films “Klute” and “The French Connection”, both achieving success on a commercial and artistic level. Through the 70s, Roy had several notable roles, including the ones in “Jaws” (1975) as Brody, a role he repeated in the sequel “Jaws 2” in 1978, “Marathon Man” (1976) as Doc, “Last Embrace” (1979) and “All That Jazz” (1979) as Joe Gideon, directed by Bob Fosse.</p><p>He continued successfully through the 1980s, adding his name to several films, including “Still Of The Night” (1982), with <a href=#>Meryl Streep</a>, “Blue thunder” (1983), “2010: The Year We Make Contact” (1984), as Dr. Heywood Floyd, with <a href=#>Helen Mirren</a> and <a href=#>John Lithgow</a>, as a sequel of Stanley Kubrick`s “2001: A Space Odyssey” from 1968. His next big role was the one in “52 Pick-Up (1986), as Harry Mitchell alongside <a href=#>Ann-Margret</a>, and in 1988 starred in “Cohen And Tate” with <a href=#>Adam Baldwin</a> and Harley Cross. Before the 1980s ended he appeared in “Night Game” and “Listen To Me”, both released in 1989.</p><p>1990s brought new challenges for Roy, and he managed to successfully deliver; he had praised appearances in such films as “The Russia Home” (1990), with<a href=#> Sean Connery</a> and <a href=#>Michelle Pfeiffer</a>, “The Myth Of Fingerprints” (1997), with<a href=#> Julianne Moore</a> and <a href=#>Noah Wyle</a>, “Evasive Action” (1998), and “RKO 281) (1999), with such greats as <a href=#>Melanie Griffith</a>, <a href=#>James Cromwell</a>, and <a href=#>Live Schreiber</a>.</p><p>In 2000s, his popularity began to decline, although he was still in the leads, however, films he made wasn`t as popular as before, including “Chain Of Command” (2000), “The Doorway” (2000), and “Daybreak”, also released in 2000. He continued with roles in “Angels Don`t Sleep Here” (2002), “Red Serpent” (2003), and ‘Love Thy Neighboor”, but all those films were failures.</p><p>Situation became even worse when he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma; however he underwent a bone marrow transplant and continued to act until his death in 2008. Some of his last film credits include films “The Poet” (2007), “if I Didn`t Care” (2007), and “Iron Cross” released several months after his death.</p><p>Thanks to his skills, Roy received several prestigious nominations and awards, including two Academy Award nomination; first one was in category Best Actor in a Leading Role for his work on the film “All That Jazz”, and second Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his work on the film “The French Connection”. Also he was nominated for the Golden Globe award in category Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Comedy or Musical for “All That Jazz”.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Roy was married two times; his first marriage was to Cynthia and it lasted from 1962 until 1989. The couple had one child. His second wife was Brenda; the couple married in 1989 and stayed together until 2008 when Roy died.
