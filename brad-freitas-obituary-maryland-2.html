He grew up in Sterling and attended Potomac Falls High School, graduating in 1999. In high school, Brad was actively involved in sports, participating in the wrestling and football teams. After moving to Frederick, Maryland as a young adult, Brad worked various jobs in the food and service industries. He became well-known locally as a bartender at Bushwaller’s Pub and later as a manager at Tauraso’s restaurant.</span></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Professional_Career></span><span><span><span>Professional Career</span></span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span><span>After high school, Brad attended Towson University and graduated with a Bachelor’s of Science degree in Electronic Media and Film. He was an accomplished photojournalist and reporter, spending over a decade providing excellent coverage for Helicopter’s Incorporated and NBC Washington. Highly regarded by his colleagues and viewers alike, Brad won two regional Emmy awards for his skilled work. Known fondly by many as “News Chopper Brad,” he captured imaginations reporting live from helicopters above bustling cities.</span></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Big_Heart_and_Great_Sense_of_Humor></span><span><span><span>A Big Heart and Great Sense of Humor</span></span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span><span><span>Those closest to Brad will remember his generosity and great sense of humor most of all. He was always one to help others in need, whether strangers or close friends in difficult times. The life of the party, Brad ensured those around him had roaring laughs and created lasting memories together. His kind spirit and comedic nature will be cherished by loved ones as they honor his legacy.</span></span></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Beloved_Father_and_Husband></span><span><span><span>Beloved Father and Husband</span></span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span><span><span>Brad was a devoted father to his young daughter Olivia. They shared a special bond exploring new places, feeding turtles at the nature preserve, visiting aquariums, and starting gymnastics lessons together recently. He enjoyed teaching her to play harmonica and sing their mutual favorite song, “You’ve Got a Friend” by James Taylor.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>In addition to Olivia, Brad is survived by his loving wife Kara Freitas; his father Bob Freitas and step-mother Allison; his sister Sarah Waldron and brother-in-law Wes; his brother Steven and sister-in-law Erin; seven cherished nieces and nephews; and countless close friends.</span></span></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Private_Memorial_for_Family_and_Friends></span><span><span><span>A Private Memorial for Family and Friends</span></span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span><span><span>After Brad’s unexpected passing on December 12th, 2023 at the age of 42, his family is planning a private memorial service in his honor. Close friends and relatives will gather to pay tribute to the caring husband, devoted father, intrepid reporter, and kind friend that touched each of their lives so meaningfully.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>In lieu of flowers or other tributes, the family asks that those wishing to honor Brad’s bright legacy consider donating to their local animal shelter in his name. It’s a fitting way to support the vulnerable animals and caring community members that Brad so clearly embodied the spirit of himself.</span></span></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Bradley_Robert_Freitas_Will_Be_Deeply_Missed></span><span><span><span>Bradley Robert Freitas Will Be Deeply Missed</span></span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span><span><span>The loss of someone so spirited at such a young age comes as tragic news for all who knew Brad. His memory will live on through his brilliant journalism accomplishments, the laughter he sparked in so many, and the love for his family. Most importantly, Brad will remain alive in the hearts of his wife, daughter, and everyone else lucky enough to call him a loyal friend. May we all honor Brad by paying forward the kindness and joy he unselfishly gave.</span></span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmanBrbHHqKysnV6asbZ61admm6qRmXqnvsSiq5qrXaSvqsDUmqmyZZ2Wv7q4wKebZmpf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./thomas-brodie-sangster-relationship-dating-history.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Thomas Brodie-Sangster In A Relationship?
