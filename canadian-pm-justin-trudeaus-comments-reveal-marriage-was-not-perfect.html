However, there was no evidence to support the speculation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/cZDhprv_xmiQfyhShbpSOgOHNdQ=/16x12/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/XCNAYUCUNFG5LKF2QCMMSEH6HI.jpg"><p>Now, the Trudeaus’ own actions and comments have thrown their relationship into the spotlight, with some believing the break up could lessen Trudeau’s re-election prospects.</p><h2 class=article__heading>Awkward video clip</h2><p>In 2020, the couple recorded an extremely awkward video message for Canada Day from Ottawa’s Food Bank Farm.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>In the version posted on the Prime Minister’s YouTube channel, the couple speak in the two official languages of Canada - English and French - and sign off the clip saying “Happy Canada Day”.</p><p>However, in an extended version of the video online, the camera remains on the pair, pausing for 15 seconds while awaiting further instruction.</p><p>Grinning in silence, the Prime Minister then leans in for a kiss. What is eye-opening is the way his wife pulls away and looks in the other direction following the brief peck.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/l0BOtDx1otqqA1z4c4fQjGSrCUs=/16x10/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/6ZQ5KHUW4RAAXKB7JIPEHK7QWE.webp"><p>While parts of the video are painfully awkward, other parts show the couple seemingly joking with each other.</p><p>A few years prior to the Canada Day interview, in 2014, the pair’s marriage was brought up while Trudeau was chatting about his memoir, <i>Common Ground.</i></p><p>“Everyone knows how challenging it is to balance family responsibilities with a job that takes me across the country and working extremely hard,” he shared with Evan Solomon, a<i> </i>CBC reporter.</p><p>“There are times when she [Gregoire] hates my job and she hates me for loving my job.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/CGHuNLhfT1RASxLyXBHTrP9qVxg=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/N56E3CGCOVASVBNZWV4J6AEVM4.jpg"><h2 class=article__heading>‘Coded language’ for an affair?</h2><p>“Our marriage isn’t perfect, and we have had difficult ups and downs, yet Sophie remains my best friend, my partner, my love,” he said.</p><p>“We are honest with each other, even when it hurts.”</p><p>Solomon enquired as to whether that was “coded language for extramarital affairs”.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>“No,” said Trudeau. “This is a conversation about the kinds of challenges that any real marriage goes through. Tremendous ups and downs, but as I say we are deeply in love and committed to each other and we continue to be.”</p><p>This wasn’t the last time the pair’s relationship problems came up in conversation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/0YOOp37x7yT_TV5_oQgj5ytUftE=/16x13/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/IX7QPCHWTUYNSUQKEZQU2B6WCU.jpg"><h2 class=article__heading>‘Dark, heavy storms’</h2><p>Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, who formerly worked as a TV reporter in Quebec, reiterated in 2015 that wedded bliss was something she and her husband occasionally missed.</p><p>“I can tell you right away that no marriage is easy,” she shared with Canada’s <i>Global News.</i></p><p>“I’m almost kind of proud of the fact that we’ve had hardship because we want authenticity; we want truth; we want to grow closer as individuals through our lifetime and we’re both dreamers and we want to be together for as long as we can.</p><p>“I’m happy that we had to go through that.”</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Last year, Gregoire again addressed her marriage struggles on social media.</p><p>“We have navigated through sunny days, heavy storms, and everything in between and it ain’t over,” she said.</p><p>“Long-term relationships are challenging in so many ways. They demand constant work, flexibility, compromise, sacrifice, devotion, patience, effort, and so much more.</p><p>“None of us are perfect and so there is no perfect relationship.”</p><p>However, she concluded, “Love conquers all”.</p><p>While the Trudeaus were candid about their marriage troubles, they also were vocal about their peaks too. The two were snapped regularly while enjoying life together.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/zwATyG_5nmsGSIe7Nn2QZa4u5xo=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/PNNASDGXZJCUE7SI7DBP62ICLM.jpg"><h2 class=article__heading>‘Persistent rumours’ about Trudeau</h2><p>However, rumours of the Trudeaus’ marriage being on the rocks continued to run rampant.</p><p>“The rumours that the couple had split, long denied, had become reality,” said the<i> Toronto Sun</i>’s Lilley.</p><p>“Over the years, journalists had made polite inquiries about Trudeau and were told there was nothing to report,” he shared after the break-up announcement was released.</p><p>“There will be rumours about what caused [the separation], the persistent rumours that the PM is or has been involved with other people will go into overdrive.”</p><p>The speculation will “show up on social media — the same place that the Trudeaus announced their split”.</p><p>However, Lilley went on to say that it was a “personal matter” and the couple should be given the privacy they asked for in their shared statement.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Lilley went on to say that there would be legitimate questions as to what extent – if at all – Gregoire will continue to benefit from the public purse in the future.</p><p>Jamie Sarkonak, writing in <i>The National Post</i>, said Trudeau’s perceived image with voters as a family man could be tarnished by the break-up.</p><p>“He can’t live by example on the family file, because he can’t claim personal success on that front.”</p><p>However, Trudeau has some time to win over the public in his new his role as, if not strictly a single man, a man estranged from his wife.</p><p>The next Canadian election is in 2025.
