The series has won 15 Emmy Awards while Keoghan has won ten of them. His career started in 1990.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Phil Keoghan is as of late 2016? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Keoghan’s net worth is as high as $12 million, an amount earned through his successful career on television. In addition to being a host of a quite popular show, Keoghan also produced and worked on other projects which improved his wealth.</p><h3>Phil Keoghan Net Worth $12 Million</h3><p>Phil Keoghan was born in New Zealand, but lived in Antigua and Canada due to his father’s work commitments. His family returned to New Zealand where he went to high school and after matriculation later studied at St Andrew’s College, Christchurch. Keoghan has a brother named Andrew Keoghan, a former television reporter and successful jazz musician, and Ruth Keoghan Cooper, the life consultant.</p><p>Phil completed his TV cameraman apprenticeship at the age of 19, and then when he was 23 he moved to the United States after his show “Keoghan’s Heroes” was picked up by a US network. Keoghan initially auditioned for a host of “Survivor”, and although was on a shortlist, the CBS chose <a href=#>Jeff Probst </a>instead, but offered Keoghan the job as a host of “The Amazing Race”, which he accepted. The series started airing in 2001, and is still running after 330 episodes, while Phil also has a long-term contract with CBS that allows him to develop other shows as well. “The Amazing Race” follows the story of multiple teams that are racing around the globe for $1,000,000 to “unusual” locations. The show’s popularity helped Keoghan to increase his net worth significantly, as he reportedly receives $100,000 per episode.</p><p>Phil hosted 11 episodes of “No Opportunity Wasted” in 2004, and has appeared in such shows as “The Tony Danza Show” (2005-2006), “The Bonnie Hunt Show” (2008-2010), and “The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson” (2005-2012). He also directed “The Ride” (2011) and “Phil Rides Across America” (2012), produced 26 episodes of “Human Edge” (2001), and 245 episodes of “The Amazing Race” since 2005, all of which have contributed steadily to his rising net worth.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Phil Keoghan married Louise Rodrigues in the late ‘80s and has a daughter with her named Elle Keoghan, born in 1995. They currently live in Los Angeles, California but also have two houses in New Zealand. Keoghan is an avid cyclist and came across information about a New Zealand cyclist named Harry Watson who formed a team which competed at the 1928 Tour de France. Then, he decided to celebrate Watson’s legacy and completed the same as his compatriot, also using the same type of gear-less bicycle.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=12.727490996399><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Phil Keoghan</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$12 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$100,000</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>May 31, 1967</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Lincoln, Canterbury, New Zealand</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5' 10¾" (1.8 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>St. Andrew's College, Christchurch</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Louise Rodrigues</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Elle Keoghan</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Elizabeth Keoghan, John Keoghan</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Siblings</td><td>Andrew Keoghan, Ruth Keoghan Cooper</td></tr><tr readability=0.30769230769231><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/PhilKeoghanOfficial</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.36842105263158><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/philkeoghan</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.375><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/philiminator/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0449070/</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nominations</td><td>Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program, Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Reality Show Host</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>The Ride</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>TV Shows</td><td>The Amazing Race, Fox After Breakfast, Breakfast Time (US)</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks readability=1.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>He frequently raises his eyebrows and pauses agonizingly before he lets the team know if he's pleased or sorry</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=23><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>[Who found the luxurious experience rather deflating]: Because if I had made it' I would be having that every day.
