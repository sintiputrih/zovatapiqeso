He was 82 years old. Former co-star Dolly Parton, 72, remembered their work together in a farewell message to the actor.</p><p class=Fg>Parton and Reynolds worked together on a 1982 film titled "The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas," and the duo <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://bit.ly/2N1XINj>performed</a> the song "Sneaking Around" in one of the scenes.</p><p class=Fg>Parton was cast in the role of brothel owner Mona Stanley while Reynolds landed the role of Sheriff Ed Earl Dodd, Stanley's love interest. Read more on our Twitter account <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/amomama_usa>@amomama_usa</a></p><p class=Fg>The “Jolene” singer was one of the many celebrities that took to social media to share their feelings and thoughts about the late star, and she made reference to his role in the film on which the two shared the big screen.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>Dolly mourns her friend</strong></p><p class=Fg>“I am today along with Burt’s millions of fans around the world as we mourn one of our favorite leading men. I know we will always remember his funny laugh, that mischievous sparkle in his eyes, and his quirky sense of humor,” she <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/DollyParton/status/1037797941069668352>tweeted</a>.</p><p class=Fg>“You will always be my favorite sheriff, rest in peace my little buddy. I will always love you.”</p><p class=Fg>-Dolly Parton, <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/DollyParton/status/1037797941069668352>Twitter</a>, September 6, 2018.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>Their famous scene together</strong></p><p class=Fg>Parton and Reynolds’s memorable scene together featured the two singing the country star’s original song “Sneakin’ Around,” both scarcely dressed following a romantic night.</p><p class=Fg>Soon, the on-screen couple starts to dance and fool around in the bathroom, putting some lotion and deodorant on, and brushing their teeth joyfully. In one cute moment, Reynolds uses a hair-drier hose as a microphone.The chemistry between the two stars seemed to be very strong, even though Parton was later going to say that filming "The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas" “was a nightmare.”</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>A star on the rise</strong></p><p class=Fg>“The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas” marked Parton’s second appearance in a Hollywood film, and it was part of her aggressive campaign to transcend her status as a country hit maker to become a mainstream superstar.</p><p class=Fg>Only 8 years before, Parton had built herself a name in the country music sphere with her unforgettable song “Jolene.” But as she <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/qa-dolly-parton-235443/>told </a>Rolling Stones once, she wanted to reach a much wider audience, and movies were only a means to that.</p><p class=Fg>“I never really had a big desire to be in the movies, although I knew if my career went the way I wanted it to, Vegas and the movies and all that stuff would eventually come,” she told the music magazine.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>The perks of being a film star</strong></p><p class=Fg>Parton is known for being outspoken and irreverent in her public conversations, and many times it is difficult to determine whether she is saying something seriously or just joking. In many occasions it is both at the same time.When she was asked if it was true that she was interested in doing more spicy scenes with Reynolds because she thought it was going to be her chance with the Hollywood’s sex symbol she said it was just “being cute and funny.”</p><p class=Fg>Nevertheless, she admitted that she suggested the producers to add more romance to their characters’s relationship.“Wouldn’t you feel like you wasted five dollars if you paid to see “Whorehouse” and you didn’t see me and Burt kiss?” she said. “I’m not going to miss my chance to kiss Burt Reynolds,” she added.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>A crossover act for the two entertainers</strong></p><p class=Fg>If the movie she made with Reynolds was a stepping-stone in her way to conquer the film industry, it also served to showcase the late actor’s lesser-known singing career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/e6bffa31340b481e3373fa6e0a31b8e21340871537973650.jpeg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Source: Getty Images.</p><p class=Fg>Apart from being the biggest male film star of his generation and an established sex-symbol, Reynolds gave it a try at becoming a music star as well, although he never achieved much success in that area.</p><p class=Fg>Nine years after singing along Parton, Reynolds <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://mentalfloss.com/article/68855/10-surprising-facts-about-burt-reynolds>released</a> a solo album titled “Ask Me What I Am,” but it was poorly received by both critics and fans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpncXBjaXqjwdGtZKudqaO8rbDSZpuopJyuerGt0a2mp6tdmrqwwMiopZqkXZnCb7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./730989-conor-mcgregor-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Conor McGregor Net Worth 2023: What Is The UFC Megastar Worth?">&larr;
