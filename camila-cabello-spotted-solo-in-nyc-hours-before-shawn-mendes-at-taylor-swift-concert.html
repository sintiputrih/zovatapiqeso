But all of that was for not as the two were seen just hours later in a "lavender haze" at <a href=#>Taylor Swift's</a> concert, all but confirming they are indeed a couple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This stroll sans Mendes comes as Cabello and Mendes sparked rumors that they were on again after they were <a href=#>seen stealing a kiss at Coachella Music Festival in April</a>. Since that time, they have been spotted together at different locals in California, including trips to Venice Beach and a Comedy Show in Los Angeles. And while the two have said nothing about their relationship status, the flames were fanned when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cabello was seen leaving the When You're Gone singer's New York City apartment</a> earlier this week.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Camila Cabello Turned Down A Major Collaboration And It Was All Because Of Fifth Harmony</a></span></p><h2 id=camila-cabello-was-solo-the-day-after-coming-from-shawn-mendes-39-apartment>Camila Cabello Was Solo The Day After Coming From Shawn Mendes' Apartment</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar52765393.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On Friday, the Worth It singer was spotted wearing a chic lace-up bustier and baggy pants after grabbing what appeared to be an iced coffee in SoHo. As she strolled through the neighborhoods of NYC with a female friend, Cabello was mum as to the status of her relationship with Mendes. But if actions speak a thousand words, the trip to the big city proves that Cabello and Mendes are closer than ever.</p><p>Stepping out from Mendes' apartment in a black top, jeans, and heels, on Thursday, Cabello appeared to be headed out for the evening without Mendes. However, Mendes was there to see her off, sporting jeans and a blue sweater, after the two spent the day shopping together in SoHo, looking like much more than friends and more like being involved in a rekindled romance instead.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Despite Her Continues Success, Camila Cabello May Have "Peaked" Already</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was not known if the Shameless singer was in town to visit Mendes specifically or <a href=#>if the two are collaborating again</a>.

As such, it would make sense for the two to be in attendance for The Eras Tour to support Swift. But it was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the affection the Senorita singers were giving one another</a> that showed the two are completely smitten with one another once again, despite earlier <a href=#>rumors that Cabello had moved on</a>.</p><p>Wearing a plunging back black shirt and flowy colorful skirt, Cabello had her arm around Mendes' shoulder during Swift's Lover. Mendes, wearing a white cut-off shirt and shorts, kept his arm around Cabello's waist during a good portion of the concert.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The PDA did not stop there, though. Throughout the night at the concert, witnesses saw the two stealing kisses and looking more in love than ever.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Are Obsessed With Swift's Surprise Songs For Her Eras Tour.

But if this weekend is any indication as to the trajectory of the relationship between Cabello and Mendes, the former (and presumably current) couple is giving off vibes of being more than just friends.
