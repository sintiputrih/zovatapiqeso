Tiffany Stewart is the wife of billionaire businessman, author, television personality, investor, and philanthropist, Mark Cuban.</span></h3><h2><span id=Early_Life>Early Life</span></h2><p>Tiffany Stewart was born on <strong>January 1, 1970</strong>. Currently, she is&nbsp;<strong>54 years old</strong> and her sun sign is Capricorn. This personality was born and raised in a middle-class family. She grew up with a sister but the two don’t get along well as they often fought when they were younger, their mother would tell them to run three times around the house and they would make peace in the meantime and get back laughing together.</p><p>Later, she started using this technique with her kids. Tiffany attended a local high school in Dallas. After matriculation, she enrolled at an unspecified university, graduating with a bachelor’s degree in the year 1993.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-184001 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tiffany-Stewart-The.jpg alt="Tiffany Stewart" width=650 height=700 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-184001 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Tiffany Stewart and Mark Cuban’s picture. Source: The Sun</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>Before she got married to Cuban, Tiffany worked as a saleswoman at an advertising agency for a long time and continued her work for some time even after marriage. This lady is often referred to as a Shark Wife or Shark Tank Spouse because her husband is one of the main “shark” investors on the ABC reality television series, ‘Shark Tank’.</p><p>However, she is distinguished from other shark wives for being “low maintenance” and for keeping a careful distance from the posh celebrity lifestyle of the rich. Moreover, as a philanthropist, she is involved with the Hoops ‘n Hopes organization. She has also donated things like baby caps to Parkland Hospital.</p><p>Likewise, she is also a board member of the Mavs Foundation and is responsible for deciding the grant recipients each year.&nbsp;Currently, she is working for her husband, managing some of his affairs.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-184005 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tiffany-Stewart-Country.jpg alt="Tiffany Stewart" width=650 height=1006 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-184005 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Tiffany Stewart and Mark Cuban posing for a picture.

The two began dating shortly after meeting and were in a relationship for 5 years before marrying. Therefore, they married in September 2002 at a ceremony held at a beach in Barbados. Only 20 people attended their wedding who were their closest friends and family.</p><p>Moreover, Russell Holloway planned their&nbsp;traditional wedding. Russell is an event planner, and he has described it as ‘elegant’. The couple has two daughters namely Alexis Sofia Cuban and Alyssa Cuban and a son named Jake Cuban. Currently, they are living in the Preston Hollow area of Dallas in a mansion.</p><p>Initially, Tiffany had a hard time getting accustomed to the posh culture that she was not interested in at all. Despite her and Mark’s huge age gap of 14 years, they have been happily married for the past decade and a half. Even though the family has many nannies, this person prefers to take care of her children on her own.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-184003 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tiffany-Stewart-The-Sun.jpg alt="Tiffany Stewart" width=650 height=433 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-184003 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Tiffany Stewart’s picture with her family.
