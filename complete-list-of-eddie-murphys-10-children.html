Be that as it may, work has not kept him away from building a very big family. His children consist of 6 daughters and 4 sons ‚Äì all from five different partners. Enjoy the read as we tell you all about Eddie Murphy‚Äôs 10 children and who their mothers are.</p><h2><strong>1. Eric Murphy&nbsp;</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>DATE OF BIRTH: </strong>Born July 10, 1989</li><li><strong>AGE:&nbsp;</strong>34 years</li><li><strong>MOTHER:&nbsp;</strong>Paulette McNeely</li><li><strong>OCCUPATION:&nbsp;</strong>Actor</li></ul><p>Eric, the oldest of Eddie Murphy‚Äôs 10 children, is 34 years old. He was born on the 10th of July 1989, somewhere in New York, which is the city his parents first met. Other than facts about his date and place of birth, nothing much is known about his early life, as he has been living completely off the spotlight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/eric-murphy-1547496537.jpg><h3><strong>Who is Paulette McNeely, Eric Murphy‚Äôs Mother?</strong></h3><p>Paulette McNeely is the mother of Eddie Murphy‚Äôs oldest son, Eric Murphy. Paulette is well-known in the American entertainment scene since she is the mother of the oldest child of the veteran actor and is associated with him. However, no information about her early years or age is made public by the media. But we assumed that she had a respectable upbringing with her family in her hometown.</p><p>Eric‚Äôs Parents, Eddie, and Paulette dated around 1988, the exact period that Eddie Murphy‚Äôs Coming To America was released. The couple were said to have dated for only a short while before calling it quits. Not much has been revealed about their relationship or why it abruptly ended. Nevertheless, the circumstances surrounding their short time together as a one-time couple resulted in the birth of their 34-year-old son</p><h3><strong>Does Eric have a Father-son relationship with his Dad?</strong></h3><p>Of course, they have a father-son relationship; after all, Eddie Murphy is his loving father, and that should count. However, not much is known if Eddie has been a father figure to Eric during his childhood. The Coming to America star who has been acting for the past three decades has kept his personal life out of touch with the public.</p><p>From the images shared on his Instagram accounts, it would seem that Eric and his father kept a low-profile father-son relationship the public is not aware of. On June 20th, 2021, He shared a photo of them with the caption ‚ÄúHappy Father‚Äôs Day to all the Dads out there. Extremely grateful for mine!! üôè‚ù§üñ§ #fathersday‚Äù The post alone says all we need to know about the kind of relationship they have made throughout the years.</p><h3><strong>What Does Eric Murphy Do for a Living?</strong></h3><p>Eric Murphy is famous as the oldest child of Eddie Murphy‚Äôs 10 children, however, multiple sources have it that he is an entrepreneur, writer, rapper, voice-over artist, and social media influencer. With all of the above attributed to him, IMBD has a little profile about Eric Murphy making contributions to some uncompleted film projects and a documentary titled Rodney‚Äôs Daughter and Love Cures Cancer: Take a Chance on Love II.</p><p>Although Eric as a writer, rapper, or voice-over artist is unconfirmed, he seems to enjoy the benefit of being the child of a celebrity. Eric is an internet personality and a social media influencer with a verified Instagram account that boasts over 29k followers. He keeps a low profile as no business activities or work-related posts have been made on his account.</p><h3><strong>Eric Murphy is in a relationship with Martin Lawrence‚Äôs Daughter.</strong></h3><p>Eric is in a relationship with Jasmine Paige Lawrence (born January 15, 1996), the Daughter of famous American comedian and actor Martin Lawrence. Jasmine is Martin‚Äôs first daughter from his first marriage with former Miss Virginia Patricia Southhall. Jasmine‚Äôs parents met in 1992, got married in 1995 and after two years of marital bliss, they got divorced.</p><p>Eric remained largely out of the public eye over the years up until he started dating Martin Lawrence‚Äôs daughter Jasmin. The two haven‚Äôt held back from posting glimpses of their love lives on social media since it became official that they are together in June 2021.</p><h2><strong>2. Bria Liana Murphy</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>DATE OF BIRTH:&nbsp;</strong>November 18, 1989</li><li><strong>AGE:&nbsp;</strong>34 years</li><li><strong>MOTHER:&nbsp;</strong>Nicole Mitchell</li><li><strong>OCCUPATION:&nbsp;</strong>Actor and Model</li></ul><p>Bria Murphy is Eddie Murphy‚Äôs second child and first daughter. She was born on the 18th of Nov, 1989 in Sacramento California. She is currently 34 years old. Bria is a few months younger than Eric, however, they don‚Äôt share the same mother.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/Bria-Murphy-640x450-1.jpg><p>Bria‚Äôs mother is Nicole Mitchell, Eddie Murphy‚Äôs ex-wife who he was married to from 1993 until 2006. Bria is Nicole‚Äôs first daughter, and also the first of five children. Her siblings are Myles, Shayne, Zola, and Bella. Although she is famous as the daughter of Eddie Murphy, the 34-year-old has made a name for herself in the entertainment industry.</p><h3><strong>Bria‚Äôs Relationship With Her Parents</strong></h3><p>With careers in modeling and acting, it is obvious that her parents have been fundamental in her upbringing. Bria has received mentorship and support from both parents who happen to have been among the best in their respective fields. Being the first child born legitimately, the 34-year-old must have enjoyed both parents‚Äô undiluted attention while growing up.</p><p>Bria‚Äôs parents speak highly of her hard work, commitment, and dedication to her career choices. At a 2020 Art exhibition show, she held in Los Angeles, Eddie Murphy could not hide how excited he was to see her stuff up on the wall. He expresses that Bria has made him a very proud parent.</p><h3><strong>She has a Flourishing Career in Modeling and Acting</strong></h3><p>Bria Liana Murphy has undoubtedly made a name for herself within the entertainment industry taking after her parents. She has demonstrated her talents and ambition in the field of modeling, fashion design, and acting. She has been featured in numerous publications, including Maxim and Vogue Italia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/og-bria-murphy-43226.jpg><p>She was approached at the beginning of her career with offers to model for numerous fashion and cosmetics companies. She also participated in New York Fashion Week and worked as the ambassador for Dark and Lovely hair dye. She gained notoriety for uploading provocative photos of herself in bikinis online.</p><p>The drama Conflict of Interest from 2017, the romantic comedy The Perfect Match from 2016, and the VH1 reality show Hollywood Exes from 2014 are just a few of Bria‚Äôs numerous TV and film appearances. She appeared in the cinema alongside her father in the popular film Daddy Daycare in 2003. Bria is also an artist, which is a career that she has been nurturing since childhood.</p><h3><strong>Bria is Married to Celebrity Actor Michael Xavier</strong></h3><p>Bria wedded her fianc√© Michael Xavier on July 9, 2022. The happy couple tied the knot in a private afternoon ceremony before 250 close friends and family. How they met and when they started dating has not been revealed, however, they were said to be engaged for 7 months before tying the knot.</p><p>Her husband, Michael Xavier (Born 20th November 1985) is a 38-year-old Canadian Actor from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. He is famous for his role in the series The Best Years, Deadly Inferno, and A Christmas Treasure.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>3. Christian Murphy</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>DATE OF BIRTH:&nbsp;</strong>November 29, 1990</li><li><strong>AGE:&nbsp;</strong>33 years</li><li><strong>MOTHER:&nbsp;</strong>Tamara Hood Johnson</li><li><strong>OCCUPATION:&nbsp;</strong>Actor and TV Personality</li></ul><p>Christian Murphy (Born November 20, 1990) is a 33-year-old famous African American actor who is mostly known as the third son of iconic Hollywood actor, Eddie Murphy. Christian was born to Tamara Hood Johnson and Eddie Murphy on the 20th of November 1990.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/Christian-Murphy-Wiki-Bio-Biodata.jpg><p>The location of his birth and how he spent his early childhood days are unknown, and like his older half-brother, he has been off the radar for most period of his life. However, it is believed that he spent most of his life with his mother Tamara Johnson, while his father follows his outstanding acting career.</p><h3><strong>Who is Tamara Hood Johnson, Christian Murphy‚Äôs Mother?</strong></h3><p>Tamara Hood Johnson is the mother of Christian Murphy, not much is known about her as she keeps her life and personal affair away from the media. Other than being one of the baby mamas of Eddie Murphy, she made headlines when multiple media sources reported that she sued a production firm in 2013 for allegedly taking the idea for ‚ÄúHollywood Exes‚Äù from her.</p><p>Tamara Hood Johnson lives in Los Angeles, California, it is unknown if that is her place of origin. She has often been confused by the media to be Tamara Johnson-George, Taj from the R&B group SWV. While little is known about her relationship with Eddie Murphy, it is no news that they share a son. Tamara raised Christian with the support of Eddie Murphy obviously, but the 33-year-old is highly fond of his mother.</p><h3><strong>His Relationship with His Father Eddie Murphy</strong></h3><p>Christian and his two older half-siblings all fall under the same age groups, which will make it impossible for them to all have the same fatherly attention as kids. While his famous father was raising a family with his first wife Nicole, Christian was being raised by his single mother Tamara whom Eddie Murphy had a brief stint.</p><p>As mentioned above, Christian spent most of his childhood with his mother, however, their present relationship points to the fact that Eddie Murphy is a loving father to all his children despite having them with different women.</p><p>On his Instagram account, Christian shares moments they had together with his father and other half-siblings. It is believed that Eddie Murphy gives all his children the attention they deserved, however, it remains to be seen if the attentions are on the same level.</p><h3><strong>Christian Murphy is an Actor and a TV Personality</strong></h3><p>Just like his father Eddie Murphy, Christian also pursues a career in acting and television entertainment. According to IMDb, he appeared in a 2008 episode of The Shield titled ‚ÄúSnitch‚Äù and the 2011 comedy-drama Cougar, Inc. alongside Denise Richards and Sarah Hyland.</p><p>He also appeared in two separate TV programs in 2011: ‚ÄúLove Cures Cancer: Take A Chance on Love II‚Äù and ‚ÄúRed Carpet Report‚Äù after it. It is unknown why Murphy has not been featured in any more movie production as it is obvious he has distanced himself from acting after 2011, as he hasn‚Äôt signed up for any films since.</p><h3><strong>Christian Murphy is Single</strong></h3><p>Christian Murphy, Eddie Murphy‚Äôs third child is single. As far as this article goes, Christian is still single and has never been married before. However, it is uncertain if the 33-year-old is currently in a serious relationship, or has any relationship at all.</p><p>According to his social media posts, Christian Murphy has a sizable number of female pals. He frequently attends events with his female friends and enjoys time by the pool. He once posted a blurry image of a girl cuddling up to him.</p><p>He frequently uploaded photos on his Instagram account with lots of stunning women. Out of all his female pals, it is challenging for us to identify who is his genuine girlfriend. Additionally, he hasn‚Äôt updated his Instagram since 2022. His last upload was done just 9 days after his birthday in 2022.</p><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><strong><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>4. Miles Mitchell Murphy</span></strong></h2><ul><li><strong>DATE OF BIRTH:&nbsp;</strong>November 7, 1992</li><li><strong>AGE:&nbsp;</strong>31 years</li><li><strong>MOTHER:&nbsp;</strong>Nicole Mitchell</li><li><strong>OCCUPATION:&nbsp;</strong>Digital Artist</li></ul><p><a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>Miles Mitchell Murphy</a> is Eddie Murphy‚Äôs overall fourth, and second child with his former wife Nicole Mitchell. Nicole Mitchell and Eddie Murphy gave birth to Miles on November 7, 1992, in Los Angeles California. The celebrity son is currently 31 years old.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/25f8f44fb7dfea75.jpg><p>Myles tries as much as possible to stay out of public and media scrutiny. He keeps an even lower profile compared to his older half-siblings. He made public appearances when he stepped out with his family at various events when he was young, including the Shrek 2 premiere in 2004 and the Daddy Day Care premiere in 2003.</p><h3><strong>Miles is Nicole Mitchell‚Äôs First Male Son For Eddie Murphy</strong></h3><p>Miles‚Äôs mother is Nicole Mitchell. He is her first male son for the Grammy Award-winning actor. Nicole Mitchell Murphy is a 55-year-old American fashion model, actress, businesswoman, and Television star. Although she is more famous as Eddie Murphy‚Äôs ex-wife of over 13 years.</p><p>Despite Miles being a grown man and having a family, his mother still sees him as her baby. Not much has been revealed about Miles‚Äôs relationship with his mother, nor has anything been discovered regarding the influence she had in his upbringing. Be that as it may, it can be deduced from pictures shared on Nicole‚Äôs Instagram account, that she must have made a tremendous impact on his upbringing positively.</p><h3><strong>Miles‚Äô Relationship With His Father, Eddie Murphy</strong></h3><p>Miles is the first to make Eddie Murphy a grandfather of all his 10 children. This amongst many other reasons has made Eddie Murphy very proud of his son and all he has achieved. Growing up, Miles had the privilege of spending quality time with his father. They have made numerous father-and-son appearances together as mentioned above.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/E831452F-37FD-433F-A28E-7391EDE68536.jpg><p>Despite their numbers and different mothers, Eddie Murphy has been able to bring together all his children and also maintained a satisfying relationship between them all. However, Miles may have seen more of his father compared to the other male children his father has from his other relationships.</p><h3><strong>What Does Miles Do For A Living?</strong></h3><p>Being the son of a highly celebrated actor like Eddie Murphy, one should expect that Miles will take after his acting career. That is not the case with Miles who is said to be living a quiet life. Although some authoritative sources have credited him as part of the production crew of some Hollywood blockbuster movies.</p><p>Even though not much is revealed about his work in the movie industry, Miles has been credited to be part of movie projects where he worked as a digital artist in the Marvel Cinematic Universe productions of Iron Man, Captain America, Avengers, Avengers: Endgame, Black Widow and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, and the 2000 film series ‚ÄúX-Men,‚Äù respectively.</p><p>Also, he worked as a compositor and digital effects artist in the 2011 film ‚ÄúI Am Number Four‚Äù. Not similar to what his Emmy awards-winning father is doing, Miles‚Äôs decision to work behind the scene is still not farfetched from Eddie Murphy‚Äôs prolific career. Miles is talented in graphics and illustrative arts, it is a career he is involved in, and seems to do perfectly well pursuing it.</p><h3><strong>Miles is in A Long Term Relationship With His Girlfriend Carly Fink</strong></h3><p>Miles has a girlfriend called Carly Fink and they have been together for a very long time. Their relationship together is said to have been over more than ten years, and they have created a lovely family, which includes a daughter. Although they have been together for that long, they are yet to tie the knot as husband and wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/3F7DFEF5-624D-4E06-B834-1E471350E9AE-640x468-1.jpeg><p>Miles and Carly have been successful in keeping their relationship a secret, and nothing is known about their dating history or personal life in the media. The pair may not yet be wed, but their dedication to one another and their family speaks volumes about the depth and intensity of their bond. Miles and Caryl‚Äôs love and commitment to one another and their family will surely endure whether or not they decide to be married in the future.</p><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><strong><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>5.

Although Shayne picked a different career for herself, her father still supports and encourages her to be the best at what she does.</p><h3><strong>Shayne Audra is A Chef Unlike Her Model Mother, Nicole Mitchell</strong></h3><p>With a variety of career choices she has to pick from, Shayne decided to not follow in the footstep of her mother‚Äôs modeling career. As we know, her mother is a retired model and founder/CEO of YFOY, a beauty and skincare business. Shayne however, decided to cook for a living. Nevertheless, Nicole has been a very prominent figure in Shayne‚Äôs life, helping to nurture the budding talent of her daughter.</p><p>By being so involved in her daughter‚Äôs life, Nicole has been able to help Shayne Audra to make the most of her modeling talent. She has helped maintain the momentum of her daughter‚Äôs cooking career by introducing her to various networks and circles, as well as offering her wisdom and advice.</p><p>Shayne is making the most of what she has learned from her mother‚Äôs busy lifestyle.
