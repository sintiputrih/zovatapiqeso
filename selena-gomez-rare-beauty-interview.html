We sat down with her for our February Badass Issue to chat everything from mental health to makeup, and she didn't hold back. Here, she talks past struggles with self-image, forgetting her passwords on purpose, and why she started her own cosmetics line, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Rare Beauty</a>, right after realizing she doesn't need makeup to feel her best.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What are some of your earliest memories with makeup?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the age of 7 I was already working and in the hair and makeup chair. Even then I noticed certain trends and how I didn't match them. That made me question my own beauty, which is a huge part of why I created Rare Beauty. I wanted quality products that I feel confident and comfortable wearing. But more importantly, I wanted to change the narrative and knock down dated beauty norms.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What was the defining moment that drove you to create Rare Beauty?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I just felt like the beauty space started to get really crowded with a lot of unrealistic messages. I had a moment where I was like, 'I'm not a makeup guru or the most incredible makeup artist, but I want to get involved.' I couldn't have been luckier with my team because everyone knows our mission. We want to make quality products, but we want there to be heart behind it.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What has it been like transitioning to the business side of beauty?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's been a learning process, but really wonderful because I have incredible people that have guided me through it. It feels really empowering to be able to have a say over everything that goes on in my company. I'm not afraid to ask the silly questions in order for me to learn more about it. I feel in control and I'm definitely proud of the work that we've done.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What have these past two years been like for you?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I became aware that my little world is complicated, but the picture is much bigger than the stuff I deal with. I have problems with depression and anxiety, and I found it difficult for me to be me. I didn't want to post anything on social media because I realized that I was in a situation where I was extremely blessed. What could I possibly post or say? Then I had the idea of inviting multiple people to be on my Instagram to tell their stories.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>You're one of the most followed women on Instagram. How does social media play a role in your self-confidence?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At one point Instagram became my whole world, and it was really dangerous. In my early 20s, I felt like I wasn't pretty enough. There was a whole period in my life when I thought I needed makeup and never wanted to be seen without it. The older I got, the more I evolved and realized that I needed to take control of what I was feeling. I wanted to be able to look in the mirror and feel confident to be who I am. Taking a break from social media was the best decision that I've ever made for my mental health. I created a system where I still don't have my passwords. And the unnecessary hate and comparisons went away once I put my phone down. I'll have moments where that weird feeling will come back, but now I have a much better relationship with myself.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>There is an abundance of celebrity-founded beauty brands right now. Where do you hope Rare Beauty fits into this conversation?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I hope that it can be a brand that people trust without it being led severely by my name. When I see makeup artists having the [Rare Beauty] blush or the lip souffle on photo shoots I get so giddy! To see that happening is one of the coolest things. Hopefully this brand can be around for a really long time that people go back to â€” not because it's mine, but because of the product.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Selena Gomez</span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you set boundaries?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I'm a big believer in therapy, and I always feel so confident when I'm taking care of myself. If I'm not in the best headspace and my friends invite me out, I won't go. I've lost my sense of FOMO, which I'm proud of. Sometimes I push myself too much, and it catches up to me. But I try to balance out everything as best as I can. I like to be there for my friends and celebrate everyone. But I have to make sure that I'm OK, you know? Because if I'm not OK, I can't be OK for other people.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What does your ideal day look like?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I like to give myself an hour to wake up and have my coffee. [laughs] Then I go to boxing, which has completely changed my life and body. It clears my head and helps me let go of stuff. I like to wash my face with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Tatcha cleanser</a> and then use the moisturizer. Sometimes I'll do a mask, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Masque</a> or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>one for my hair</a> from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nofollow>K18</a>, which makes me feel like a grown woman. [laughs] I love a five-minute cold shower to reset my mind.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Also, I'm obsessed with soft things. I just went to the Ugg store for the first time and fell in love. I was on cloud nine buying sweats, socks, and blankets. To me, there's nothing better than wearing your favorite cozy outfit, sitting by a fireplace, and having a tea moment. I'm like an 80-year-old woman. [laughs]</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What else are you most ambitious for?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Changing the narrative of mental health and creating a curriculum that hopefully can be implemented in schools or a system for resources that are easily available. [<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Mental Health 101</a> can be found on the Rare Beauty site.] I'm just so passionate about that, and I think I will continue to be for the rest of my life. Especially since the pandemic, there are so many people I know who craved help but had no idea how to get it. I have big aspirations for that field and really want to implement more education behind it.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-selenas-rare-beauty-picks></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Selena's Rare Beauty Picks</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Liquid Blush</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Rare Beauty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">$20, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>sephora.com</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Warm Wishes Effortless Bronzer Stick</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Rare Beauty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">$23, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>sephora.com</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Perfect Strokes Universal Volumizing Mascara</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">$20; rarebeauty.com.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Always an Optimist Soft Radiance Setting Powder</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">$22; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>rarebeauty.com</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For more stories like this, pick up the February issue of InStyle, available on newsstands, on Amazon, and for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener nofollow">digital download</a> Jan. 14th.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCmuMSnmGafn6Kyu3nRmqmeZZKarrbA2Gagp6yVp8OqsdY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./travis-scott-holds-his-kylie-jenners-daughter-stormi-in-new-pic.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Travis Scott Holds His, Kylie Jenners Daughter Stormi in New Pic">&larr;
