The rapper was known for his memorable <a href=#><strong>music</strong></a> that was sometimes controversial. During that time, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen had acquired a huge fanbase after years of acting in Full House and in many direct-to-video movies.</p><p>While Eminem might not have much in common with the <a href=#>Olsens, who are living more privately now</a> than they used to, he once wrote about them in a song that got a lot of attention. However, it's fair to say that the song became so well-known because the lyrics were problematic and inappropriate. Here's what Eminem wrote about the Olsen twins and whether he ended up fighting with them as a result.</p><h2 id=what-song-lyrics-did-eminem-write-about-mary-kate-and-ashley-olsen>What Song Lyrics Did Eminem Write About Mary-Kate And Ashley Olsen?</h2><p>On June 7th, 2005, Eminem's fifth album, "Encore," was released. The song "A** Like That" stood out immediately because he wrote about several female celebrities, including Mary-Kate Olsen, Ashley Olsen, Jessica Simpson, and Hilary Duff.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mary-kate-ashley-olsen.jpg><p>The song title is pretty self-explanatory, but the lyrics are still surprising since they are fairly inappropriate. In the second verse, Eminem sang about the Olsen twins: "Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome/Now they getting older." He then mentioned Mary-Kate again: "I did not even get to see Mary-Kate shower scene."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened Between The Olsen Twins And Dylan And Cole Sprouse?</a></span></p><p>The Olsen twins aren't the only stars whom Eminem has written about. There was a period of his music career when he was well-known for insulting famous people.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In his song "Rain Man," he wrote some terrible lyrics about Jessica Simpson. In his song "Marshall Mathers," he made fun of Britney Spears, NSYNC, and the Backstreet Boys. He also wrote some offensive and inappropriate lyrics about Moby in "Without Me."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/eminem-skipped-out-on-his-2003-oscar-win-and-regretted-it-afterwards.jpg><p>While the rapper didn't mention Christina Aguilera in his song "A** Like That," she took issue with the fact that he wrote some violent lyrics about his ex-wife Kim Scott Mathers.</p><p>According to Buzzfeed, Aguilera called it "disturbing" when filming an interview for a documentary that aired on MTV. She said, “Girls out there, you’ve got to pull the plug on situations like that, don’t let a guy disrespect you." Eminem then said that the pop singer should have stayed silent instead of mentioning him, and he sounded angry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-eminem-fight-with-mary-kate-and-ashley-olsen>Did Eminem Fight With Mary-Kate And Ashley Olsen?</h2><p>While no one would blame Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen if they said that they were upset with what Eminem wrote about them in his song "A** Like That," they don't seem to ever have responded. This is what fans would expect from the Olsen twins as even when they were more visible in Hollywood, they still weren't interviewed very often.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mary-kate-ashley-olsen-1.jpg><p>Sometimes the twins would talk about their current projects, like their popular direct-to-video movies. But they didn't talk to the media as much as some other celebrities.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Mark Wahlberg Doesn't Like Being Compared To Eminem, And That Was Evident Based On An Interview Response</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2004, when "A** Like That" was released, the Olsen twins were 18 years old. Before that point, they starred in many popular movies that came out in the 1990s such as Billboard Dad, It Takes Two, and Passport To Paris. They also starred in the TV series Two Of a Kind, which only had one season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/did-eminem-s-uncomfortable-lyrics-about-mary-kate-and-ashley-olsen-spark-a-feud-between-the-stars_.jpg><p>In 2004, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen were wrapping up their acting careers. While they starred in the 2004 movie New York Minute, that would be their last film. When Eminem's song came out, they were starting their adult lives and getting ready to become college students at New York University. They might not have wanted to respond to the song since they were focused on other things.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It doesn't seem like Eminem fought with any other the other stars whom he wrote about in "A** Like That."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/miranda-lambert-s-true-feelings-towards-gwen-stefani-1.jpg><p>In 2015, Eminem talked about "A** Like That" in an interview with The New York Times. When the fact that he mentioned Gwen Stefani in the song came up, he said that in his opinion, he wasn't saying anything offensive.</p><p>Eminem explained, “I don’t think it was ever anything that was disrespectful. I mean, maybe I said she could pee-pee on me, but I don’t care who you are—that’s funny regardless. But I’ve always respected Gwen Stefani. She’s an incredible talent, but also her longevity is one of the reasons she was perfect for that song.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Eminem Has A Specific Reason He Doesn't Tease Albums Before Dropping New Music</a></span></p><p>When Eminem wrote and sang the song "Kings Never Die," which was featured in the movie Southpaw that was released in 2015, he wanted Stefani to lend her voice to the tune. Since she did, that suggests that she wasn't upset or mad at what the rapper once wrote about her. As Stefani told Entertainment Tonight, "I've been asking for so long to do something with him. I think he's so incredible, a real artist, he's a real weirdo, we all know that."</p><h2 id=what-does-eminem-think-about-his-song-quot-a-like-that-quot-today>What Does Eminem Think About His Song "A** Like That" Today?</h2><p>Eminem's album "Encore" was definitely different from his previous four. But while it seems like the rapper was trying to be funny in many of his songs, many of his song lyrics were upsetting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/eminem-looking-concerned.jpg><p>In 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eminem talked about his music</a> in an interview with Complex. He explained that he didn't feel that "Encore" was as good as his previous work and that he was aware that people didn't love the new album as much. He shared that because he was addicted to substances, he recorded "silly songs" as a result of his "goofy mood."</p><p>The rapper also told XXL that he knew that he wasn't receiving tons of praise for "Encore." He said, “I released what I had at that point in time, and I feel that put a kind of a mark on my catalog. Encore did some decent numbers, but I was never that concerned with numbers. I was more so worried about what people think about the album. Critics and fans were important to me, and they were always at me about that project.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdmrqqusSmZKynnpx6rcXRopqsZZGXvLbAjKaYq7FdoK61sYyapZ1lkai1rbHYZqalq5WjerS8wKuiZpldm7K2sI4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./phil-keoghan-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Phil Keoghan Net Worth">&larr;
