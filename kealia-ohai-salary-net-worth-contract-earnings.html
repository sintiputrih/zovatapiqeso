She was the Houston Dash's highest scorer in the 2019 NWLS season with a tie score with Lynn Williams, the golden boot winner.</span></p><p><span>Kealia, who hailed from the high school football leagues, was named&nbsp;Gatorade state player of the year two times and first-team high school All-America from 2007 to 2009.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Kealia Ohia Traded&nbsp;To&nbsp;Chicago Red Stars From&nbsp;Houston Dash</strong></span></h2><p><span>On 6 January 2020, Houston Dash announced Kealia Ohai got traded to Chicago Red Stars in exchange to defender Katie Naughton. With a departure, the professional soccer player also will&nbsp;be the grand marshal for the annual Downtown Rodeo Parade&nbsp;on 29 February 2020.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The president and CEO of Houston Dash thanked Kealia for her outstanding leadership for the city of Houston. They mentioned that it was a matter of honor to have her leading the Downtown Rodeo Parade. Kealia will be soon starting the 2020 season with Chicago Red Stars.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Kealia&nbsp;Ohai's Net Worth? Are Female Soccer Players&nbsp;Paid Less Salary?</strong></span></h2><p><span>As a National soccer player from the United States, Kealia Ohai is entitled to a salary of $37,800, which is far less in comparison to the men's payment. Due to that, her net worth is likely lesser than the top male soccer stars.</span></p><p><span>As per money.com, NWSL pays the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">salary</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;$265,000&nbsp;to the female soccer players, whereas male players&nbsp;have an earnings of an average of over&nbsp;$300,000 and a median of $100,000 in the Major League Soccer.</span></p><p><span>The payment does not seem fair concerning the prize of FIFA, the governing body of world football. The total worth of Women's World Cup 2019's prize valued only $30 million,&nbsp;whereas the total prize budget for the 2018 men's World Cup football&nbsp;was $400 million. Despite the fact, the Secretary-General of FIFA mentioned:</span></p><p><span><strong>"We are still another 23 World Cups before potentially women should receive the same amount as men."</strong></span></p><p><span>The Wall Street Journal mentioned that Women's football generates more <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revenue</a>&nbsp;than the men's football for the&nbsp;U.S. Soccer Federation (USSF). However, there are no sections that run under the equality basis in the football world.</span></p><p><span>It does not mean that there are no steps taken for equal pay for players. Back in 2016, five players filed&nbsp;a complaint&nbsp;with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), and twenty-eight players filed a lawsuit concerning gender discrimination and unequal pay.</span></p><p><span>Similarly, the Ballon d'Or winner&nbsp;Ada Hegerberg, the French Women National Team, and&nbsp;Professional Footballers Australia (PFA) are fighting to fill up the vast pay gap between male and female footballers.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span><strong>Kealia's&nbsp;Previous Contract&nbsp;And Stats</strong></span></h2><p><span>Kealia Ohai was an outstanding soccer player since her academic years. During her time in the Alta High School, she was a&nbsp;four-year varsity soccer player who led her team to the state soccer championships for four consecutive years from 2006 to 2009. Similarly, she was named Gatorade state player of the year two times,&nbsp;first-team high school All-America from 2007 to 2009, and also a three-time 5A soccer MVP.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>She also played from North Carolina Tar Heels from 2010-13 and also won the NCAA Division I Women's Soccer Championship. During the Freshman year of her career in Tar Heels, she&nbsp;got&nbsp;a named to the ACC All-Freshman Team and&nbsp;First-Team All-Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Later, Houston Dash selected Kealia on their 2nd overall pick in the&nbsp;2014 NWSL College Draft. After a couple of years of signing a contract with Houston,&nbsp;she became the team captain in 2016 and finished the season with being tied with Lynn Williams for the golden boot. Although she did not win the golden boot, she got named to&nbsp;the 2016 NWSL&nbsp;Best XI.</span></p><p><span><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/Sports/kealia-ohia-football.jpg alt width=450 height=415 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span></p><p><span>Kealia Ohia during her game from Houston Dash (©: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram/Kealia Ohia</a>)</span></p><p><span>Her stats from Houston Dash in the 2019 NWSL marks two shots with two shots on target.&nbsp;Kealia also holds a record of most scores for Houston Dash with 28 goals. She played a total of 1,801 minutes&nbsp;in 23 games, with&nbsp;73.7% tackles won and a 59.7% pass rate.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Kealia&nbsp;In An International&nbsp;Platform</strong></span></h2><p><span>Talented from a young age, Kealia Ohia played the&nbsp;under-15, under-17, under-18,&nbsp;under-20, and the&nbsp;under-23&nbsp;championship&nbsp;for&nbsp;the United States. She was in the team of the 2012 US U-20 Women's National Team and won the U-20 World Cup, scoring a game-winning game against Germany in the finals.</span></p><p><span>Similarly, she made her debut in the senior team on 23 October 2016 against a friendly match with Switzerland. Also, she set the record of the fastest goal in the Women's football history by scoring a goal in 88 seconds after the substitution.</span></p><h2><span><strong>She Missed The Remainder of The 2017 Season Due To Injury</strong></span></h2><p><span>Kealia Ohia missed the remaining games of the 2017 NWLS, for she injured her left knee against the game with&nbsp;Orlando Pride on 24 June 2017. The medical assessment suggested that she went through a diagnosis with&nbsp;a Grade 3 ACL sprain&nbsp;and medial meniscus tear.</span></p><p><span><strong>Know On Her Personal Life: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kealia Ohai Wedding With Her Fiance JJ Watt— Bequeath Engagement Ring At Beachside Engagement</a></strong></span></p><p><span>Houston Dash announced that she would be put to the bench for the rest of the 2017 season because of her injury. Head Coach,&nbsp;Omar Morales mentioned that Kealia's damage was a big hit for the team and its performance.</span></p><p><span>Similarly, Kealia tweeted that she got devastated but also excited to recover and get back to the field.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunC%2Fz6ipratfoLKiuMiaZKigkZ56tK3LmqmyZZ6awW7DzquroWWTpLu1vsCcq2adkae7qrrGrA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./comrade28.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="King Canute IV Svendsson Of Denmark : Family tree by comrade28">&larr;
