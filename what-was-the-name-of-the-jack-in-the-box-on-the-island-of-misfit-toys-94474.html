He states that his name is the reason he is a misfit toy, claiming that no child wants to play with a Charlie-in-the-Box.</p><p>My favorite part in this stop-motion holiday special is when Rudolf and Hermey the Elf stumble upon the Island of Misfit Toys.

The Island of Misfit Toys was a place where unwanted or unloved toys go to live.</p><p>After being cast out by their respective tribes, the trio turns to each other for companionship. During their travels through the North Pole, they accidentally land on the Island of Misfit Toys, where those that are broken or unwanted go to live until they can find a child who will love them.</p><h2>What animals are in the jack in the box?</h2><p>Residents include a jack-in-the-box named<strong> Charlie, a spotted elephant, a choo-choo train with square wheels on the caboose, a water pistol that shoots jelly, a bird that doesn’t fly, a cowboy who rides an ostrich, and a boat that can’t stay afloat.</strong></p><p>It’s been<strong> 55 years</strong> since Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer first premiered on NBC, and watching the beloved TV special is still a Christmastime tradition for many families. You couldn’t ask for a more inspiring gang of outsiders than Rudolph, wannabe dentist/elf Hermey, and everyone’s favorite prospector, Yukon Cornelius.</p><p>As<strong> the special underwent revisions over the years,</strong> Dolly got more screen time and lines, making her lack of a physical defect more apparent. Source: CBS. Two years before his death, Arthur was asked about what makes Rudolph timeless. “I really don’t have an answer to that,” he confessed.</p><h2>What is the island of misfit toys?</h2><p>The Island of Misfit Toys was<strong> a place where unwanted or unloved toys go to live.</strong> These toys usually have some form of defect or were just created differently, like a spotted elephant, a lion with wings, a train with square wheels, and a water pistol that shot jelly. Whether by manufacturing defect or damage, they don’t say, but if we were to follow the logic of the movie’s universe, wherein all toys in the world are made independently at Santa’s workshop, then it’s fair to say that these toys were discarded by Santa himself.</p><p>Most millennials will probably be aware of the phrase “Welcome to the Island of Misfit Toys”, made popular by Stephen Chbosky’s book<strong> The Perks of Being a Wallflower,</strong> which was turned into a highly successful teen movie. In the book/movie, Sam and Patrick introduce fellow outcast Charlie into their group, inducting him via a house party, …</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In the 2001 Rudolph movie, the focus is shifted on the misfit toys, their plight as unwanted creatures, eventually culminating in the (spoiler alert) revelation that the Toy Taker himself was an unwanted toy who just<strong> wants to save other misfit toys from being unloved and unwanted.</strong></p><p>The movie is an origin story for Rudolph;<strong> beginning with his discovery by Santa and Mrs. Claus</strong> (we also learn that Rudolph is<strong> the son of Donner, Santa’s lead reindeer).</strong> A majority of the movie deals with Rudolph being tormented for his nose, him running away and meeting Hermey the elf (who ran away because he wanted to be a dentist rather …</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2b6%2FEpZybqpmpxm%2ByzGiuoZmkYsSiv4ytn55lnpa6pnnOn2StoJVit6Kvymagp2WknbJurs6xZKimXam1pnnIrKOappRivKd5zKKqn6GkYsGwxdJmcG1sZ2l8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tony-xu-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Will Tony Xu's Net Worth Increase After DoorDash's IPO?">&larr;
