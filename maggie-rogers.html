Rogers went to social media to express her anger and was praised by her followers, the public and media outlets.</p><p>At NYU, Rogers considered a career in music journalism, and in her freshman year, Rogers interned for music journalist Lizzy Goodman for whom she transcribed and edited hundreds of hours of interviews with major musicians and journalists, which would be later compiled into Goodman's 2017 book Meet Me in the Bathroom.</p><p>Rogers' EP, Now That the Light Is Fading, was released on February 17, 2017.

Folk blog EarToTheGround Music explained that the album "...begs for listeners to confront deep personal emotions."</p><p>The summer after her junior year, Rogers attended a Berklee College of Music program and won the program's songwriting contest, which spurred her to focus on writing. During her senior year, she turned a broom closet into a makeshift studio and recorded what became her first album, The Echo (2012). Rogers included her demos as part of her application to New York University's <a href=#>Clive Davis</a> Institute of Recorded Music.
