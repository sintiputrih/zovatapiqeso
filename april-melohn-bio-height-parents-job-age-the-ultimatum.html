This exotic beauty is one of the casts of Netflix’s original dating show The Ultimatum. She has given her boyfriend Jake the ultimatum to either get married or move on with their lives. Colby & Madlyn, Shanique & Randall, Rae & Zay, Nate & Lauren, and Alexis & Hunter are the other couples who will be joining them.</p><p>On 4 March 2022, April announced on her IG, “This was a hard secret to keep! Stay tuned & watch me on @UltimatumNetflix: Marry or Move On Premiering on April 6th on Netflix! #Netflix&nbsp;#UltimatumNetflix”.</p><p>Learn about April’s journey in the show. Furthermore, you’ll explore details about her parents, siblings, job, and her age.</p><h3><b>The Ultimatum: Are April Melohn And Jake Cunningham Still Together?</b></h3><p>April Marie Melohn and Jake Cunningham started dating on 18 September 2019 (according to an <a href=#>FB post</a>). She wants her relationship to proceed to the next step after two years of dating. So, April gave Jake the ultimatum for the simple reason that she wanted a ring and a kid with him.</p><p>Given the way she opened up about their sexual/medical past and almost elopement, it wasn’t like he was against it either, but it was only a matter of time. After all, the then-26-year-old had recently left the military after a 5-year stint, and he wanted to travel, gain financial stability, and even settle into who he truly is before committing to his partner for the rest of his life.</p><p>As a result, Jake was adamant about joining the Netflix original, but April persuaded him, confident in their love connection, only for it to fail. He struck a spark with Rae Williams, who checked every single one of his boxes after they split up and started dating among the other casts. He didn’t stop feeling bad or loving April, though, and he was completely honest with both his original and new partners.</p><p>But, even if April was with Colby, it crushed her to see Jake happy with someone who wasn’t her.</p><p>The reunion of the original couple was awkward to say the least, especially given what Jake had learned about himself and relationships in general from Rae, as well as April’s actions. The latter was actually about her recent interactions with males outside of the experiment, as well as how selfish she was (in his opinion) throughout their relationship.</p><p>As if that wasn’t bad enough, April then searched through Jake’s phone without his permission, betraying his confidence to the point where it almost seemed like they were done, but things quickly improved.</p><p>April and Jake both expressed serious regret for their acts near the end of the eight-week period, after which the former Marine Corps officer returned to his normal self. They appeared to have just remembered why they’d entered such a scenario in the first place and chosen to fight for it – rather than against it – once more. There’s no disputing that they wanted to keep their relationship going because even April’s late monthly cycle didn’t seem to bother them, but things got a little difficult when Rae became single for good.</p><p>But viewers may wonder are April and Jake still together after the show?</p><p>Based on their internet presence, it appears that April and Jake are no longer together. They don’t follow each other on Instagram, and there’s no new evidence of any sort of relationship between them on either of their social media accounts. Moreover, Jake’s relationship status on Facebook is currently marked as “single,” implying that he and April are calling it quits on their long-term relationship, who b.t.w has also marked being “single” on her Facebook.</p><h3><b>April Melohn Height</b></h3><p>With a moderate height of 5 feet 1 inch, April Melohn is blessed with an exotic look because of her mixed heritage.
