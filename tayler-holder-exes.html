Tayler revealed that the two had broken up in a YouTube <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video from August of 2019.</a></p><p>"I don't hate Kaylyn at all. We're still friends and we're going to continue to hang out. I'm going to support her in everything that she does. She's amazing, like all around," he said. He then explained that Kaylyn was busy, which had led to their split.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"With everything going on in her life right now, she's just not ready for a relationship. I respect that because she was very honest and came to me and told me right away," he continued.</p><p>Before he dated Kaylyn, Tayler teased that he was interested in pursuing Logan Paul's former assistant, Ayla Woodruff. He jokingly asked her to be his girlfriend in a Mukbang video he uploaded in February of 2019.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Following the end of his relationship with Kaylyn, Tayler teased a romance with Dixie D'Amelio. The two frequently posted TikTok content together toward the end of 2019 (they were both in the Hype House at that time), and many fans expected one of them to post about their relationship on Valentine's Day.&nbsp;</p><p>The speculation was never confirmed, and Dixie moved on with her Attaway General co-star Griffin Johnson.</p><p>For several years, Tayler also taunted fans on YouTube with a potential relationship with his best friend, Kelianne Stankus. While it does not appear as if the two did date, they did kiss for the camera in a bid to get more views in a 2017 video. They also pretended to be a couple for another video in June of 2020, but Kelianne went on to be in a relationship with model Chase Mattson.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>While Tayler's list of exes consisted of fellow internet stars, he then went on to date a new woman who was also quite familiar with the public eye. Beginning in May of 2020, fans started suspecting that Tayler and model <a href=#>Sommer Ray</a> were dating. Tayler posted a TikTok video about being "booed up" and he tagged Sommer. In the TikTok, he also wrote "5.19.20," which appears to be the date that they began seeing one another.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Shortly before her relationship with Tayler began, Sommer was rumored to be with Machine Gun Kelly.</p><p>Fellow TikTok star Bryce Hall later essentially confirmed that Tayler and Sommer were dating during a livestream on the app. "It looks like they are," Bryce said when asked if Sommer and Tayler were an item. "They're definitely feeling all up on each other's faces and stuff." He later joked that they were "definitely, maybe... kissing. I will say that they have probably kissed."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>your apology needs to be as loud as your disrespect was</p>â€” Sommer Ray (@SommerRay) <a href=#>June 15, 2020</a></figure><p>After Sommer tweeted about being disrespected on June 16, 2020, many of her fans assumed that she was referring to Tayler, and that the two had broken up. "Your apology needs to be as loud as your disrespect was," she wrote in the cryptic message.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>At the time, it was reported that the two had unfollowed one another on Instagram.</p><p>If the couple did split, then their breakup was short-lived as they began posting PDA-filled photos and videos together again soon after. They were also spotted out in public together less than a week after Sommer posted her tweet.

In their March breakup video, they'd said they were ending things amicably and that it was simply a matter of bad timing.</p><p>After his breakup with Charly, Tayler appeared to be focused on his music for a while.
