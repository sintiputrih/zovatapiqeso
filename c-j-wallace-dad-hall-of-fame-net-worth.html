He is widely acknowledged for his songs like Juicy, Big Poppa, One More Chance, Who Shot Ya, Gimme The Loot, Suicidal Thoughts, and more. Many artists take Notorious B.I.G, also known as Biggie and Tupac, as the main inspiration of their career; after all, he has credited numerous accolades in the music industry.</span></p><p><span>Nevertheless, Biggie's years of hardships and contribution to the music industry paid off. Biggie, who died on 9 March 1997, will be inducted into the&nbsp;Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&nbsp;to commemorate his long-term music career. C.J. Wallace, Biggie's son, and an aspiring American actor spoke regarding his later father's musical excellence and the honor of getting such privilege.</span></p><p><span>Biggie is one of the 2020 class of honorees alongside several musical icons, including Whitney Houston,&nbsp;Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails, T-Rex, and the Doobie Brothers.</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/celebs/cj-wallce-biggie.jpg alt="cj wallce biggie" width=650 height=433 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>C.J. Wallace and his dad, Biggie (©: People)</strong></p><p><span>Speaking with the show's host, Lawrence K. Jackson, Wallace mentioned:</span></p><p><span><strong>"It's a huge year and for it to end this way — if he were here, he would be delighted. It's about time. He deserves it. He's an icon in his own and he deserves to be mentioned among other icons."</strong></span></p><p><span><strong>"People often forget that he was human. He was a regular guy. He loved to make people laugh. He loved to care for his people and do as much as he could for his friends and family. The Hip Hop Mount Rushmore — he is for sure on that list.&nbsp;He is this huge iconic figure and it's hard to separate the human from the icon sometimes," he adds "If the world doesn't know anything about Christopher Wallace, it's definitely that he had a good heart and he was a great spirit."</strong></span></p><p><span>C.J. Wallace further said that his late dad would have been very excited about his Hall of Fame induction if he was alive at this moment. <strong>'He would be proud to see how far hip hop, Black culture, and the inspiration of Black culture has come,'</strong> Wallace continued.</span></p><p><span><strong>See This:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>How Old Is Chris Wallace?
