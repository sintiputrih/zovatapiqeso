Sure, some of the winners aren't quite as famous as others, but many of them are still household names.</p><p>Ruben Studdard was the winner of the show's second season, and he has been doing really well ever since. Let's take a look at what happened to him after he took home that big prize in 2003.</p><h2 id=an-amazing-experience>An "Amazing" Experience</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelly Clarkson has done a lot since her win</a>, and it's safe to say that she's the most famous and successful person to have won the show.</p><p>Ruben Studdard has done well for himself and back in 2014, he told&nbsp;Rachel Martin at NPR&nbsp;that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Idol&nbsp;was an "amazing" experience</a>.

He said, "You know, that was my story. You know, I started doing everything I could since I was 12 years old to be, you know, to get discovered or, you know, go to XYZ audition, send in demo tapes."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Studdard continued that when he was able to audition for&nbsp;Idol,&nbsp;it was the right time. He said, "And the blessing is that I was prepared for the opportunity when it presented itself. My mother used to always tell me that preparation determines your destination. And I prepared myself to be ready when that door opened for me."</p><h2 id=making-music>Making Music</h2><p>Ruben Studdard has been continually making music since he won&nbsp;American Idol.</p><p>In the 2014 interview with&nbsp;NPR, he talked about touring with&nbsp;Lalah Hathaway, who is the daughter of Donny Hathaway, who he really looks up to.</p><p>Studdard also has released many albums.

He also came out with an album that was a tribute to Vandross. He told&nbsp;Vaildaily.com, “I really appreciate the opportunity to go around the country performing his songs and sharing these nostalgic moments with people that remember his music. People are receiving it really well. People just love Luther. It’s like going out and doing a tribute to The Beatles."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Happened To American Idol Runner-Up, Clay Aiken?</a></span></p><h2 id=time-on-the-biggest-loser>Time On 'The Biggest Loser'</h2><p>Years after winning the second season of&nbsp;American Idol, Ruben Studdard became a contestant on season 15 of&nbsp;The Biggest Loser&nbsp;in 2013 and 2014.
