But not all went to plan when Paul's character, an actor in the theatre production named Ben Gilroy, dies on stage. This immediately set up the plot for season three!</p><p id=ewEzDBZUYLK data-wc=14><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Why did Only Murders in the Building star Jesse Williams leave Grey’s Anatomy?</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=elKAJhPpn_L data-wc=12><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>The Bear season 3 – what to expect from show's return</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8e89f69ad325-paul-rudd-only-murders.png><p id=e2V9uRV7IDr data-wc=71>Fortunately, we will get to see Paul as Ben before he's murdered in the show because the third installment will take a look at the events that lead up to his murder to try and uncover the truth behind what really happened. Away from Only Murders, Paul is known for his roles in a huge list of brilliant titles including Ant-Man, Clueless, Friends, I Love You, Man, Anchorman, and plenty more.</p><h2>Meryl Streep as Loretta Durkin</h2><p id=eVqNeLPKPaJ data-wc=66>Oscar-winning actress and Hollywood darling Meryl Streep delighted fans when she was revealed as a new cast member to join Only Murders. The A-lister is playing the part of Loretta Durkin, a Broadway star appearing in Oliver's play. However, that's all we really know so far. Could be she the murder suspect? Or a key person in solving the mystery? We can't wait to find out.</p><p id=eoq3I5y3vNo data-wc=37>You don't need us to tell you how brilliant Meryl's expansive acting career is. Some of her biggest roles include Kramer vs. Kramer, The Devil Wears Prada, Big Little Lies, Mamma Mia, Angels in America&nbsp;and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/68cb085483f1-meryl-streep-only-murders.jpg><h2>Ashley Park as Kimber</h2><p id=eCiOy_VktC5 data-wc=54>Emily in Paris&nbsp;star Ashley Park joined the cast of Only Murders in the Building&nbsp;and we can't wait to see her in action! Ashley plays the role of Kimber, a Broadway actress who is also involved in Oliver's play. We're sure we'll get to know more about her as the episodes roll on…</p><p id=eI1dbrXQO_p data-wc=29>Ashley is not only known for her role as Lily Collins' on-screen BFF in&nbsp;Emily in Paris, but she's also recently led the cast of the comedy film, Joyride.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cb8197720fcf-ashley-park-omitb.jpg><h2>Selena Gomez as Mabel Mora</h2><p id=ekA5Vjgq2pe data-wc=62>Although Steve Martin and Martin Short bring the esteemed, comedic flair to the show thanks to their long-running partnership in film, Selena Gomez is the cherry on top. Mabel Mora is back on form and ready to solve the murder case. And this time she's putting Charles and Oliver in their place even more so in the third season. Bring it on.</p><p id=e0YZb3mMJXs5 data-wc=34>Selena is adored for her acting role in Only Murders&nbsp;but she's also a mega superstar singer, too. Her other acting credits include Monte Carlo, Spring Breakers, The Wizards of Waverley Place and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ef1912681270-selena-gomez-omitb.jpg><h2>Steve Martin as Charles Savage</h2><p id=ekY2-auAh_LG data-wc=97>As mentioned, Steve Martin is back as Charles Haden-Savage – the actor-turned-podcaster and crime solver. The former Brassos actor moved into the Arconia and had the shock of his life when he found himself solving a murder along with two of his neighbors, and documenting it for a true crime audio series as the same time. But, now? He thrives in the excitement! In season three, Charles is returning to acting and has a role in Oliver's new stage production, but looks like he has beef with Ben Glenroy. We'll have to wait to find out more.</p><p id=ecgU4vLrvQhC data-wc=38>Away from his work alongside Martin Short (more on that below), multiple award-winning actor and comedian Steve Martin is known for his work in The Man with Two Brains, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, Cheaper By the Dozen&nbsp;and more.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2660908d6e7c-steve-martin-only-murders.jpg><h2>Martin Short as Oliver Putnam</h2><p id=eJem0ceXT-iM data-wc=45>Oliver Putnam has finally got his work on the stage. But the murder somewhat dampens the excitement… In season three, we'll see Oliver battle to save his theatre and directing career once and for all, all the while figuring out who killed his leading star.</p><p id=eH-mImDwUF2M data-wc=42>Martin Short is, of course, back to play the eccentric and hilarious character. The Emmy and Tony Award-winning star is, as mentioned, a long-running partner of Steve Martin, and the pair's joint credits include The Three Amigos&nbsp;and Father of the Bride.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/747cf12433a3-martin-short-omitb.jpg><h2>Who else is in the Only Murders in the Building cast?</h2><p id=eZLKUGg5wwaZ data-wc=38>Other big names set to appear in Only Murders season three include Jackson Avery himself Jesse Williams.
