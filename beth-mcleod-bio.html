But in 2019, her life took a tragic turn when she lost her husband and her mother in a short span of time. She decided to make a radical career change and became a nightclub owner, creating some of the most unique and fun nightlife destinations in Cleveland. In this article, we will explore how Beth McLeod went from weather to nightlife, and how she found a new purpose and joy in her life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Losing her Best Friend</h2><p>Beth McLeod was married to Fred McLeod for over 28 years. A reunion that has seen the pair climb through the ranks of journalism. While Fred worked as a play-by-play sportscaster for the Cleveland Cavaliers, Beth made a name for herself as a meteorologist.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Fred-Mcleod-wife-Beth-McLeod.jpg><p>In September 2019, Fred McLeod passed away suddenly after suffering from a massive heart attack. The death of Fred came as a shock to the fans but the one in the most pain was Beth. After all, the couple had been together for 28 years and always made sure that they didn’t stay apart for more than three days.</p><p>“For a good three days my life was just a blur of a good two weeks of time. I don’t remember the funeral. I don’t remember the visitation. I don’t remember a lot. It’s like you’ve been hit by a bus and you can’t get up. It’s really a heavy feeling and I can’t describe it and some days are better than others.”</p><p>Things went from bad to worse for Beth, who lost her mother after five weeks of losing her husband. Not taking anything away from the grief, Beth had already been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mourning</a> her mother for two years.</p><p>“It’s hard to tell the story because I don’t think many people believe that, like, my husband died suddenly and then my mom died but I think my mom had been sick for two years. So, not that that’s easier, but I think I’ve been mourning her for two years as she progressed.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rising Through the Ranks</h2><p>Beth began her professional career at CBS Sports in New York but later moved to WDIV in Detroit, Michigan. She stayed in Michigan for over 17 years. She left WDIV to be closer to Fred, who at the time was working in Cleveland. She joined&nbsp; WOIO in Cleveland and started working as a weather forecaster and worked for almost 10 years before joining Fox 8 News Channel in Cleveland as a resident meteorologist.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Meteorologist-Beth-McLeod.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Switching Career- Beth Became a Nightclub Owner in 2020</h2><p>Beth McLeod is a former meteorologist who switched to becoming a nightclub owner after the death of her husband, Fred McLeod, in 2019.&nbsp;She bought the disco Good Night John Boy in 2020, during the peak of the pandemic, and joined Forward Hospitality Group, a company that owns, operates and creates new nightlife and restaurant concepts.&nbsp;She <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that buying the nightclub not only changed her life but saved it.&nbsp;She also opened two more bars, Welcome to the Farm and XMAS Bar, in 2021 and 2022 respectively.&nbsp;Her boyfriend, Bobby Sotka, is in charge of operating the clubs.&nbsp;She said that she enjoys creating memories, friendships, and happy times for her customers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Beth McLeod Background & Family</h2><p>Elizabeth Heather Henningsen was born on the 31st of March 1965, in Bay Village, Ohio, USA.

As for her education, Beth graduated from Northville High School in Northville, Michigan, and moved to Michigan State University.&nbsp; She graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Broadcast Journalism and later finished her Master’s degree in Meteorology from Mississippi State University.</p><p>Beth and Fred met while she was working on the NBA Finals for CBS Sports. Fred helped Beth to create an audition tape and the pair began dating soon after. The pair tied the knot in 1991, and while they had no children of their own, Fred had three from his previous marriage.&nbsp;Following the death of her husband Beth has remained unmarried&nbsp;and has been a strong advocate for health problems and actively participates in the cause.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fred McLeod-Who is Beth McLeod’s Late Husband Fred McLeod?</h2><p>Fred McLeod was an American sportscaster.
