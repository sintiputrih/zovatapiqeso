Why is it that Bravo worshipers like ourselves need to know things like arithmetic, grammar, and stupid bullshit about sports when most Americans don’t even know how many sitting presidents have been to the wedding of a former Real Housewife? (Answer: <a href=#>One</a>.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl6p7gppv000x3b728fftdtqk@published data-word-count=96>To celebrate our wealth of deep knowledge about the franchise we love, I asked members of the <a href=#>Housewives Institute</a> to submit their own multiple-choice trivia questions so we could come up with the ultimate test of Housewife knowledge. You sure delivered: The Institute got more than 100 questions (some of them duplicates), and from those, I’ve selected the 30 best, funniest, and sure to stump. They get progressively harder, and if you get all 30 right, you win a prize. That prize is knowing a shit ton about the Housewives. It’s worth its weight in gold.</p><h2 class=quiz-title data-editable=title>The Ultimate Real Housewives Quiz</h2><p class=instructions data-editable=instructions>How many can you get right?</p>Which designer was responsible for Alex McCord's shoes that Luann called a "mistake"?<p class=option>Herman Munster</p><p class=option>Louis Vuitton</p><p class=option>Christian Louboutin</p><p class=option>Jimmy Choo</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. Never forget that trip to Morocco.</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Incorrect. Luann called them Herman Munster shoes, but they were indeed made by Louis Vuitton.</span> According to NeNe Leakes, which color refrigerator is not acceptable?<p class=option>A clear door like Yolanda Foster’s</p><p class=option>Black</p><p class=option>Silver</p><p class=option>White</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. You can hear the GIF, can’t you?</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Incorrect. It was Kenya Moore’s house with a white refrigerator that NeNe made fun of.</span> What two things did Dorinda do in order to “make it nice” for her guests at Blue Stone Manor?<p class=option>Cooked and decorated</p><p class=option>Cooked and cleaned</p><p class=option>Decorated and shopped</p><p class=option>Drank and napped</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. Congrats, you really listen. Dorinda would be happy.</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Incorrect. If you picked "Drank and napped," you are technically correct, but she told everyone she cooked and decorated.</span> Designer and former RHOC cast member Lynne Curtin designs what kind of lovely accessories?<p class=option>Statement necklaces</p><p class=option>Pearl-string thong underwear</p><p class=option>Cuff bracelets</p><p class=option>Baby hair bows</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. Not the kind of cuffs that the Countess wore, mind you.</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Incorrect. How could you forget about the cuffs? You can still get them <a href=#>on her website</a> for $148.</span> In the RHOA premiere, Shereé throws a birthday party but “forgets” to add one of her castmates to the guest list. Which castmate was it?<p class=option>DeShawn Snow</p><p class=option>Kim Zolciak</p><p class=option>NeNe Leakes</p><p class=option>Lisa Wu</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. And thus the best of frenemies were born.</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Incorrect. It was NeNe. You probably don’t remember, because it’s when she had long hair. I blocked that out too.</span> Who has had romantic relationships with the most Housewives cast members?<p class=option>Slade Smiley</p><p class=option>Will Smith</p><p class=option>Harry Dubin</p><p class=option>Simon Guobadia</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. The kissing bandit of New York strikes again.</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Will Smith has had two, Simon Guobadia has had two, Slade Smiley has had three, but it is Harry Dubin with four (Aviva Drescher, Luann de Lesseps, Sonja Morgan, and Ramona Singer) who wins.</span> How many times has Danielle Staub been engaged?<p class=option>None</p><p class=option>17</p><p class=option>19</p><p class=option>21</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. This was a tricky one. Good job</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Incorrect. Of course, Teresa Giudice yelled she was “engaged 19 times” right before the infamous table flip, but she has been engaged two times since then for a total of 21.</span> Where did Gretchen Rossi vacation when her fiancé was in the hospital?<p class=option>Lake Tahoe</p><p class=option>Bass Lake</p><p class=option>Lake Mead</p><p class=option>The Lady Pond</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. Named after LVP’s favorite member of NSYNC.</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Incorrect. If you weren’t so naked wasted, you would know that it is Bass Lake.</span> Who was the youngest ever Real Housewife at the time of her first appearance on the show?<p class=option>Whitney Rose</p><p class=option>Ashley Darby</p><p class=option>Meghan King Edmonds</p><p class=option>Jo De La Rosa</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. This was a tricky one; you must be an RHOC OG.</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Incorrect. While Ashley is often cited as the youngest Housewife, Jo De La Rosa, the former almost Mrs. Slade Smiley, was only 24 way back during season one of RHOC.</span> Which Housewife has not shit herself (at least that we know of)?<p class=option>Ramona Singer</p><p class=option>Gizelle Bryant</p><p class=option>LeeAnne Locken</p><p class=option>Dorinda Medley</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. Unless you count her shitty home renovation, it’s all Gizelle.</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Incorrect. Gizelle only had a shitty home renovation not actual poop anywhere outside of a toilet.</span> Where was Vicki going when she had her epic "family van" meltdown?<p class=option>On a two-and-a-half-week cruise</p><p class=option>On vacation to Puerto Vallarta</p><p class=option>To Chicago for a family reunion</p><p class=option>To Andale’s to whoop it up</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. Wow, you are an OG just like Vicki.</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Incorrect. You would think it would be to her favorite place south of the border, but you would be wrong.</span> Which restaurant, known for its cheeky take on dishes, such as Lobster Pop-Tarts served in giant toasters, has been featured on RHOC, RHOA, and RHONY?<p class=option>The Carl</p><p class=option>The Quiet Woman</p><p class=option>Barton G.</p><p class=option>Rails Steakhouse</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. "<a href=#>Life is not a cabaret, Luann!</a>" —Bethenny Frankel</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Incorrect. It's Barton G., with outposts in L.A. and Miami, that the ladies have been to — including when Bethenny told Luann that <a href=#>life is not a cabaret</a>.</span> Which of the following Housewives has NOT thrown a glass at a castmate?<p class=option>Lisa Rinna</p><p class=option>Ramona Singer</p><p class=option>Dorinda Medley</p><p class=option>Brandi Glanville</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. She’s thrown plenty of shade, but no tableware.</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Incorrect. Lisa threw one at Kim Richards, Ramona threw one at Kristen Taekman, and Brandi threw one at Eileen Davidson. That leaves just Dorinda, who will shout "CLIP!" but never threw a glass.</span> Who came up with “Blue Stone Manor” for the name of Dorinda Medley’s surely haunted Berkshires manse?<p class=option>Carole Radziwill</p><p class=option>Dorinda Medley</p><p class=option>Bethenny Frankel</p><p class=option>Ramona Singer</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. That’s why they call her “writer girl.”</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Incorrect. Good guess, but it was actually “writer girl” herself, Carole.</span> Which of these was not a Kyle Richards tagline?<p class=option>I’m not the richest girl in Beverly Hills, but I am the luckiest.</p><p class=option>I’m born and raised in Beverly Hills. This is my town.</p><p class=option>In Beverly Hills, you can be anything, but it’s most important to be yourself.</p><p class=option>It's all fun and games in Beverly Hills as long as you're holding the winning hand.</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. If only she were holding the winning hand on game night.</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Incorrect. If only she were holding the winning hand on game night.</span> What is the real name of the island that has been dubbed Scary Island?<p class=option>St. Croix</p><p class=option>St. John</p><p class=option>St. Thomas</p><p class=option>St. Lucia</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. “Satchels of gold, Al Sharpton. She’s a vampire!” is also an acceptable answer.</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Incorrect. Sorry, it’s St. John. After that visit, it sank into the sea.</span> Which of these is not one of Heather Dubrow's IMDb credits?<p class=option>Married With Children</p><p class=option>Hawaii Five-0</p><p class=option>CSI</p><p class=option>Early Edition</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. And let us not forget Malibu Country.</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Incorrect. It is actually CSI, but good guess.</span> Who is Tarzan?<p class=option>Dorit's abandoned dog</p><p class=option>A stripper Phaedra hires</p><p class=option>Bethenny’s assistant</p><p class=option>Joe Gorga’s penis</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. Who else gets that poison out?</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Incorrect. Nope, it’s Joe Gorga’s penis. You would think it might have a more Italian name.</span> What is the name of the RHONY episode when Luann pleads, “Please, don’t let it be about Tom”?<p class=option>"Any Tom, Dick, or Harry"</p><p class=option>"Tomcat"</p><p class=option>"Tomfoolery"</p><p class=option>"Peeping Tom"</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. You cannot be fooled.</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Incorrect. Those Bravo episode namers are clever, and “Tomfoolery” wins.</span> In season three of RHOBH, Taylor Armstrong meets Dana Wilkey for drinks. How does Dana light her cigarette?<p class=option>She asks the kitchen staff to light it for her.</p><p class=option>With her $25,000 sunglasses.</p><p class=option>She flirts with a man to light her cigarette.</p><p class=option>Using a candle on the table. Classy.</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. Come on, Dana, light our fire.</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Incorrect. It was a candle on the table. That’s what we loved about our Dana. Never gauche at all.</span> “Who is Adrienne Maloof in this world?”<p class=option>Someone who washes chicken with soap</p><p class=option>Someone who has the finest of hair tinsel</p><p class=option>Someone Yolanda Foster doesn't know (i.e, not important)</p><p class=option>The queen of the mole people who live under the mountain</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. While all of the answers are correct, that is what Yolanda meant when she asked this question for us.</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Incorrect. While all of the answers are correct, it's clear what Yolanda meant when she asked this question.</span> Carole Radziwill once said she only has “five good summers left.” When is that last good summer?<p class=option>2018</p><p class=option>2020</p><p class=option>2022</p><p class=option>2025</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. <a href=#>Liza Minnelli has outlived Carole Radziwill’s last good summer</a>.</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Incorrect. She made the edict in 2015, making the horrible COVID summer of 2020 her last good one. Maybe she can get a refund.</span> RHOC ex-husband Lou Knickerbocker started an energy-drink brand that employed several Housewives' daughters as models. What were they collectively called?<p class=option>OC Angels</p><p class=option>Aqua Angels</p><p class=option>OC Chicks</p><p class=option>OC Babes</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. I’m sure you already know that the gate of his house is still in the opening credits.</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Incorrect. It was the OC Angels, and they probably deserved their own reality show.</span> Which German-born real-estate developer had confrontations with both NeNe Leakes and Mama Elsa Patton?<p class=option>Thomas Kramer</p><p class=option>Lee Najjar</p><p class=option>Dwight Eubanks</p><p class=option>Romain Zago</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. Since you know this, he probably haunts your dreams too.</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Incorrect. Thomas Kramer was the man with all the creepy sculptures around his house whom NeNe fought with after her famous altercation with Kim on the tour bus.</span> Which of the following is not one of Sonja Morgan's interns?<p class=option>Pickles</p><p class=option>Connor</p><p class=option>Matthew</p><p class=option>Constance</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. Yeah, we just made Constance up.</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Incorrect. It was Constance. Please tell me you at least remember Pickles.</span> Which Housewife said she could see herself winning an Oscar one day?<p class=option>Heather Dubrow</p><p class=option>Shereé Whitfield</p><p class=option>Kandi Burruss</p><p class=option>Luann de Lesseps</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. Her Oscar is coming spring, summer, spring/summer.</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Incorrect. Shockingly it is Shereé who had a brief flirtation with acting before realizing she was awful at it.</span> In season seven of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, which RHONY cast member did Adrian Pimento claim to have worked for as a PI (and slept with in a tiny hotel Jacuzzi)?<p class=option>Luann</p><p class=option>Sonja</p><p class=option>Ramona</p><p class=option>Bethenny</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. Honestly, we could see it.</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Incorrect. The funniest one for him to be in a tiny Jacuzzi with is Countess Luann, so that is the right answer.</span> Who was on Yolanda Foster’s "dream team"?<p class=option>Kyle, Kim, LVP</p><p class=option>Brandi, Joyce, Kim</p><p class=option>Brandi, LVP, Carlton</p><p class=option>Kyle, LVP, Brandi</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. And look at the dream team — all unemployed.</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Nope, it was Brandi, LVP, and Carlton, who just cast a spell on you for not getting this right.</span> Which Housewife was once the special-guest general manager on an episode of WWE Monday Night Raw?<p class=option>NeNe Leakes</p><p class=option>Dorinda Medley</p><p class=option>Denise Richards</p><p class=option>Lisa Rinna</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Correct. You watch wrestling and Housewives? Who even are you?</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>Incorrect. The Housewives Institute has been informed it was NeNe. We got this one wrong too.</span> What is the secret ingredient in Kim Richards's chicken salad?<p class=option>Termite eggs from her stolen house</p><p class=option>&nbsp;Tarragon</p><p class=option>Hellmann's</p><p class=option>Stirring with her hands</p><span class="result correct hidden" data-editable=correctAnswerResultText>Tarragon. Of course, tarragon.</span> <span class="result incorrect hidden" data-editable=incorrectAnswerResultText>You might think it is her manual method of preparing it, but it is actually tarragon.</span><p class="mc-description hidden"></p><a aria-label="Share on Facebook" class="share custom-share-fb" href=#></a><a aria-label="Share on Twitter" class="share custom-share-twitter" href=#></a><p data-editable=source class=source></p><h2 class=title>Sign up for the Housewives Institute Bulletin</h2>Dame Brian Moylan breaks down all the gossip and drama, on- and off-screen, for dedicated students of the Reality Television Arts and Sciences.
