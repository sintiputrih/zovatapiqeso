But the actor is already in his 30’s. Yes! And while he may have garnered credits to over 50 TV shows/movies, the charmer was more in the spotlight for dating quite a few amazing personalities — including Elon Musk’s ex-wife!</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Let’s discuss his relationship and dating history below.</span></p><h3><b>Is Thomas Brodie-Sangster In A Relationship With Talulah Riley?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Yes, Thomas Brodie-Sangster was in a relationship with Talulah Riley as of 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Reportedly, the two began dating back in the summer of 2021 after meeting on the set of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Pistols</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. For those of you interested, the TV mini-series was all about the Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones, where Thomas and Talulah portrayed Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood respectively.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But though the stars were already coupled then, it wasn’t until November that year, the world became aware of them. Also, since Talulah was in an on-off relationship with Matthew Rice then, no one doubted that the two would split for real.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“Talulah was dating Matthew right up until the spring, and he’s still a little shocked and saddened it has all ended between them,” a source shared.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The last we saw Thomas and Talulah was in Feb 2022, out to lunch at the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Cleethorpes Pier</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. But that wasn’t the only time the duo went out for a chippie. Just a month before, the couple made it to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Papas</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, for that delicious fish and chips which cost just £8.99.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Well, considering Thomas was dating the ex-wife of the world’s richest person, it was one hell of a bargain.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For those of you who don’t know, Talulah and Elon Musk were married from 2010 to 2012, and 2013 to 2014. Yes! They were married and divorced twice. She is Elon’s second wife. Previously, the SpaceX founder was married to Justine Musk for eight long years until 2008.</span></p><h3><b>Thomas Brodie-Sangster Dating History</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Thomas Brodie-Sangster’s last known girlfriend before Talulah was the IG star, photographer, and model, Gzi Wisdom. The two made their relationship IG official on Valentine’s Day 2019. (<a href=#>Alprazolam</a>) However, reports had that the pair were together since 2016.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Since making it official, the duo often graced events together including Raindance Film Festival and The Gentleman’s Journal Summer Party. Furthermore, they even appeared in a music video together. It was on a British band Hotel Lux’s track “Ballad Of You & I.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The two were last seen together in 2020. So, that was probably the year, Thomas and Gzi went their separate ways.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Before Gzi, Thomas was dating the former child actress, Isabella Melling. The duo started their relationship in December 2012 and also went on to make several public appearances together including the one at the 2016 London Critics’ Circle Film Awards.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sadly, their relationship came to an end in 2016.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for Thomas’ earliest relationship, rumors had that the actor dated the designer Patience Harding from 2008 to 2009. However, there was never enough evidence to confirm the matter.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Here’s a little info, if you’re interested in Thomas’ girlfriends:</span></p><p><b>Talulah Riley: </b><span style=font-weight:400>She is an English model and actress who’s popular for her role in the movies</span><i><span style=font-weight:400> Pride & Prejudice, The Boat That Rocked</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Inception</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. But she was mostly known as Elon Musk’s ex-wife who received $16 million in the divorce settlement.</span></p><p><b>Gzi Wisdom: </b><span style=font-weight:400>This IG star has over 150K followers over her account @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>gziwisdom</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>. She is popular for sharing a range of fashionable outfit photos and landscape shots from throughout the United Kingdom.</span></p><p><b>Isabella Melling: </b><span style=font-weight:400>An actress and production manager best known for her role as “Wendy Richardson” in the TV series, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>My Parents Are Aliens</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. Here’s her fan page @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>isabella.h.melling</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><h3><b>Has Thomas Brodie-Sangster Ever Been Married In The Past?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>No, Thomas Brodie-Sangster was never married in the past before dating Talulah Riley.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This never aging actor was so dedicated to his profession, he never thought about settling down. However, he did try his shots at love, only to fail each time.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Talking about his dedication, Thomas once even leaned to play-guitar left-handed for his role as “Paul” in </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Nowhere Boy</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (2009). However, the actor already knew how to play guitar and drums (right-handed), all thanks to his father.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>How Old Was Thomas Brodie-Sangster When He Starred In Maze Runner?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Thomas was in all three seasons of the Maze Runner.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, he was 24 when he appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Maze Runner</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (2014), 25 on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (2015), and 28 on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Maze Runner: The Death Cure</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (2018).</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>What Was Thomas Brodie-Sangster Age When He Appeared In Nanny McPhee?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Thomas was 15 when he appeared as Simon on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Nanny McPhee</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2005.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>What Was Thomas Brodie-Sangster Age When He Starred In Game Of Thrones?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Thomas was 23 when he first appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Game of Thrones</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2013.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He portrayed Jojen Reed, the son of Lord Howland Reed and younger brother of Meera Reed.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>How Much Is Thomas Brodie-Sangster Net Worth?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>As of 2022, Thomas Brodie-Sangster flaunted a net worth of over $3 million.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Here’s his IG @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>samohtsangster</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmraCfoq60ecGrpp2hlWLAorrGrKueql2nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1usMCtoKefXZ22tMDOq7Bo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jonathan-groff.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jonathan Groff Net Worth, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More">&larr;
