But this news didnâ€™t please a lot of people, especially Riddleâ€™s ex-girlfriend, who sarcastically taunted him via Twitter while stating how terrible a father he is. She also took a personal jab at Misha, describing her as a risky po*nstar.</p><p>Daniella Petrowâ€™s response came as a result of a fan accountâ€™s tweet of disgust towards The Original Bro. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Matt Riddle</a>â€˜s ex stated that he is a sexual abuser who never looks at his kids. Daniella addressed the fact that the irresponsible Riddle is not even concerned about his kid with medical issues and prefers partying with Montana. Petrow even added that Matt does not even like or want kids in the future. She concluded by saying that she is happy that karma did not fail her and gave luck to the couple.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The fan accountâ€™s tweet criticized WWE Superstar, stating him as an abuser and a total piece of sh*t who willingly impregnated her girlfriend. Although he knows that he is irresponsible as a father and doesnâ€™t get included in his kidsâ€™ lives. And even this hatred came as a reply to WrestlingNewsCoâ€™s tweet showing the news of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mishaâ€™s pregnancy</a>. Matt got hatred from even the Twitter universe, which agreed with Daniellaâ€™s words and showed their disgust.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>He never sees his own kids , she doesnâ€™t even take care of her kid w medical issues,both non stop party.

Matt has a set of twin daughters and a son from his wife. He was also accused of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sexual assault</a> during his affair with independent wrestler Candi Cartwright. He also accepted his mistake of having an affair, which affected his marriage and caused it to break up.

As a result, McIntyre came in to save him from the wrath of The Ring General.</p><p>In a recent interview with WWEâ€™s The Bump, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Drew McIntyre </a>described Matt as a madman who wrestles barefoot. But he still manages to not break his toe, but he gets his ankle broken every week. McIntyre said that he tapes up his ankle first and gets his boots done with the taped feet, unlike the madman Riddle.</p><p>Matt and Drew will be pairing up on the next episode of RAW to take on Imperium. McIntyre will be seen further feuding with Gunther and challenging him for his Intercontinental Title at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SummerSlam</a>.
