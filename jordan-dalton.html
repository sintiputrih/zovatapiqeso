Moreover, she did her master’s degree at the University of Southern Denmark.</p><h2><span id=Professional_career>Professional career</span></h2><p>Jordon is a philanthropist as well as a housewife. She is also recognized for co-founding a charitable foundation with her husband, Andy & Jordan Dalton Foundation, which helps sick and physically challenged children, as well as their parents, have a better and happier life. She&nbsp;is the foundation’s Vice President.</p><h4>Andy Dalton</h4><p>Andy Dalton is an American football quarterback who plays for the National Football League’s Chicago Bears (NFL). Moreover, he was previously a member of the Cincinnati Bengals and Dallas Cowboys, earning the nickname “The Red Rifle.” He was a quarterback at TCU, where he led the team in quarterback wins and won the Rose Bowl in 2011.</p><p>In addition, he was drafted in the second round of the 2011 NFL Draft and spent his first nine seasons with the Bengals. He was a three-time Pro Bowl selection with Cincinnati, and from 2011 to 2015, he was the only quarterback in franchise history to lead the Bengals to five straight postseason appearances. He and wide receiver A. J. Green set rookie quarterback/receiver records for completions and yards in their first season together.</p><p>He was also one of ten NFL quarterbacks to throw for more than 3,000 yards in his first three seasons, one of six to throw for more than 20 touchdowns in his first three seasons. And also he was one of five to reach the playoffs in his first five seasons. He achieved franchise records for passing yards in a season, passing touchdowns in a season, and lifetime passing touchdowns at the end of his Bengals career.</p><p>Andy went winless in the playoffs despite his regular-season success, and the Bengals fired him in 2020 after four straight losing seasons. He then signed a one-year deal with the Cowboys as a backup quarterback for Dak Prescott, which led to him being named the starter after Prescott’s season was cut short due to injury. He joined the Bears in 2021 after departing Dallas.</p><h2><span id=Awards_and_Net_worth>Awards and Net worth</span></h2><p>As of now, Jordon has not won any awards nor got a nomination. Looking at her work and charitable work, we can assume that, she will receive some of them in upcoming years.</p><p>Talking about her net worth, there is no information regarding her, net worth, income, and salary.
