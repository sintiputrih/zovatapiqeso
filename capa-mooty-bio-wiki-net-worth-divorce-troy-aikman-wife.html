We were not able to find any details about the names of her parents or siblings. Before she met Troy, she was a relative unknown and used to a quiet, private life.</p><p>This is why details about her scarce because she is a private person who likes to keep her life away from the spotlight. She must have been an outstanding student, especially if her current position is anything to go by. Capa is a fashion retailer and entrepreneur. She presently lives with her husband and their children kids in Texas. Her life has not always been a bed of roses, as she has had to deal with a few ups and downs.
