They're pigs at feeders and a large flock may drive away the cardinals, finches and chickadees. Try scattering millet and cracked corn on the ground under a tree at least 30 feet from your feeders. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on startribune.com</a><h2>Are sparrows aggressive to other birds?</h2>House Sparrows are extremely aggressive. They will harass, attack, and kill adult native birds when competing for nest sites, and destroy their eggs and young. They also overwhelm birdfeeders, driving native birds away. The breeding season for House Sparrows begins very early in the spring or even in midwinter. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on nabluebirdsociety.org</a><h2>Can a finch and sparrow mate?</h2>Yes, small bird species such as finches and sparrows can crossbreed with each other. However, it's important to note that the offspring of such crossbreeding may or may not be fertile, and the resulting hybrids may exhibit a combination of traits from both parent species. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on quora.com</a><h2>What birds scare away sparrows?</h2>Hawks are a natural predator of sparrows.

Sometimes the feeders can get clogged and you need to clean them and put in fresh seeds. That happens to my Squirrel Buster seed feeders.
