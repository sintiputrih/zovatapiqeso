"I'm just going to try it one match at a time and see how it goes," adding: "I think I will take it one step at a time. I struggled with a lot of injuries during this year."&nbsp;</p><h2>Contemplating Last Year's Setback</h2><p id=egImXJ7wxW data-wc=41>Reflecting on last year's defeat – following her back-to-back runs in the Wimbledon finals – Ons shared: "Not going to lie but it took me maybe months just to get back to playing on tennis courts and to have that joy."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/74d6e6995952-albindurandalbin-asics-tennis-rally-for-the-mind-paris-may-24-id.jpg><p id=eeAtmx4zVV data-wc=48>Getting back to training was somewhat of a challenge at first. "I think at certain times, I was just playing because I had to be there," she adds. "You can definitely see the results weren't so great because I think it affected me more than I expected it.&nbsp;</p><figure class="quoteClass_qcs0mq1 -category-celebrities -style-2"><p id=e9Iz-7bcZY3>"I thought crying would help, but it definitely did not"</p></figure><p id=eW35rcaNtB data-wc=62>"I thought crying would help, but it definitely did not. I had more inside me, I had to accept that it is what it is, and I believe in destiny. I believe that everything happens for a reason. I was trying to find that reason to teach me and maybe I will be able to win my first Grand Slam one day."&nbsp;</p><h2>Support from the Princess of Wales</h2><p id=eoOKHFEIdd data-wc=47>In a rare display of emotion, the Princess of Wales appeared to tear up as she watched Ons lose the game. Asked about the royal's support over the past two years, Ons says: "She was really the nicest. She has watched me twice, losing the final twice.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e0bc3c42af7f-gettyimages-1545860788.jpg><p id=e-UO-7PPtZ data-wc=43>"She kept asking me if she could hug me, and I was like, 'Who doesn't want a hug from a Princess, you know?' "For me, it was such an amazing moment. And not just that, I felt her kindness and energy around me."&nbsp;</p><p id=eMjBvLWtBq data-wc=30>Ons will be among the many hoping to see the Princess return to Wimbledon – something which is yet to be confirmed by the Palace amid her treatment for cancer.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/64afde87e704-kate-middleton-wipes-tear.jpg><p id=efBLh_uoTO data-wc=48>"I really wish her a speedy recovery," adds Ons. "I know she's going through a tough time. She's been there when I was struggling, and I hope I can really send my energy there for her. She's such a nice person, and I wish her all the best."</p><p id=eR7rMCGr6q data-wc=32>The tennis star also confessed Kate's backing has inspired her more than ever before. "Honestly, it's an honour," continues Ons. "I always try to behave in the nicest way on the court.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">Ons Jabeur's tennis career in numbers</h3><h2>Meet tennis player Ons Jabeur&nbsp;</h2><p id=e1o3QZFyYh><strong>Date of Birth:&nbsp;</strong>28 August 1994</p><p id=e4bihqgqp3><strong>Place of Birth:</strong> Ksar Hellal, Tunisia</p><p id=ebeeuXQSub><strong>Nationality:</strong> Tunisian</p><p id=eJfz1YtQs1><strong>Profession:</strong> Professional Tennis Player</p><p id=efmQLKuT43><strong>Highest Singles Ranking:</strong> No. 2 (achieved on June 2022) Grand Slam Singles&nbsp;</p><p id=eHoi75YG-r><strong>Performances:&nbsp;</strong>Australian Open: Quarterfinalist (2020) French Open: Quarterfinalist (2020 )Wimbledon: Runner-up (2022, 2023) US Open: Runner-up (2022)&nbsp;</p><p id=epKEn5dz2H><strong>Notable Achievements:</strong> First Arab Woman: To win a WTA title (Birmingham Classic, 2021)To reach the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam (Australian Open, 2020)To reach the finals of Wimbledon and the US Open</p><p id=epYBPILmXx><strong>Background and Personal Life:&nbsp;</strong>Started playing tennis at the age of three.

But having her support, I think gives me extra motivation to really play good.

She has since played in two Wimbledon finals, repeating the feat at the US Open.&nbsp;</p><figure class="quoteClass_qcs0mq1 -category-celebrities -style-2"><p id=eaVqV-gAJIA>"Women can get married, have a job and still enjoy life"</p></figure><p id=eHyUPyNmtw data-wc=35>On the pressure to win a Grand Slam singles title – something which she is on course to do in her career – Ons says: "There's a good amount of pressure there, it's completely normal.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b385663d92e7-gettyimages-2156004585.jpg><p id=ekGqYJvaKP data-wc=65>"It's my choice, I chose to not just play for myself but to play for a lot of people and to inspire a lot of people.

Even when I got married, people thought I was just going to have a baby and stay home - that's not the case. Women can get married, have a job and enjoy life. For me, I decided to replace the word pressure with pleasure."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/80c9bac21491-albindurandalbin-asics-tennis-rally-for-the-mind-paris-may-24-id.jpg><p id=eLy3qgNZHD data-wc=63>Ons admits she has been "waiting for this moment and patiently for years now". She adds: "It would mean a lot to me. I feel like I owe it not just to myself but for the people who love and support me and are waiting for that. It's become a bit of a challenge but I want to show that everything is possible."&nbsp;</p><h2>Balancing Career and Personal Life</h2><p id=e9tYGG1c-m data-wc=39>The sports star is married to Karim Kamoun, a Russian-Tunisian former fencer who has been her fitness coach since mid-2017. The couple have hopes of having children one day, with Ons focused on continuing her career well into motherhood.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/425c53ab7fd7-gettyimages-1244505071.jpg><p id=erxZTqqvT- data-wc=58>"I would probably be playing on and off," she says. "I see myself as a mum for sure. Maybe I'll have a baby and come back [to court] because it's also another challenge that I want to show that it is possible to be a mum and play again. But for sure I see myself having a child."&nbsp;</p><figure class="quoteClass_qcs0mq1 -category-celebrities -style-2"><p id=enwhwbpCJZO>"I chose to not just play for myself but for a lot of people and to inspire"</p></figure><p id=eZsaRQY8qj data-wc=42>It's been a busy few weeks for Ons, preparing for Wimbledon and becoming the latest brand ambassador for ASICS. "It's an honour," she states. "We share the same values so it's very important for me to work with such an amazing team."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/44687f90a20c-gettyimages-1257871470.jpg><p id=ebphOj4WOu data-wc=42>Talking about the brand's ethos of playing tennis with movement on her mind, Ons explains: "It depends, I always do the work every day to stay focused and relax, you know as much as possible. I have a great team behind me.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/267297c68c23-gettyimages-2155729112.jpg><p id=eID1UKYflb data-wc=46>"So mentally I try to meditate a lot and breathe a lot.
