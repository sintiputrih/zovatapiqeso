In one shot, Tom is wearing a onesie with the words “I adore my papa” inscribed on it. Another depicts the couple kissing and holding mugs with the words “father bear” and “mother bear” written on them.</p><p>Kaley Cuoco is also shown displaying at least four pregnancy tests and Tom cuddling her swelling tummy in the series.</p><p>Tom Pelphrey also posted identical photographs on his Instagram account, writing:</p><p>“And then it got even BETTER. @kaleycuoco, I adore you more than ever.”</p><p>Kaley Cuoco’s pregnancy announcement comes five months after she and Pelphrey made their Instagram romance public in May 2022.</p><h2>Kaley Cuoco has sworn never to marry again.</h2><p>Kaley Cuoco and Tom Pelphrey met after the former had two unsuccessful marriages and many relationships.&nbsp;After courting for many months, the 36-year-old married former professional tennis player Ryan Sweeting on New Year’s Eve in 2013. Their relationship, however, was short-lived, and Cuoco filed for divorce 21 months later.</p><p>In a 2018 interview with Cosmopoliton, the Big Bang Theory actor shared a bad encounter with Sweeting, saying:</p><p>“I honestly believed I’d never get married again.” That term was tarnished for me by my ex. When I first married, I married someone who absolutely transformed my life. The person I ended up with was not the first person I met. That wasn’t my fault; it was his.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Kaley-Cuoco-1.jpg alt="Kaley Cuoco" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Cuoco started dating Karl Cook shortly after her divorce from Sweeting, and the two connected through their similar love of horses, dogs, and equestrian events. Cook proposed to her on her 32nd birthday, two months into their relationship, on November 30, 2017, in front of her friends.&nbsp;In an interview with Us Weekly in September 2017, Kaley raved about her then-partner, saying:</p><p>“I couldn’t be more thrilled. I consider myself quite fortunate to have met someone like him.”</p><p>The couple married on June 30, 2018, at a ranch outside of San Diego, California. Cuoco and Cook’s marriage, however, was unconventional in that they did not live together until 2019.</p><p>During an interview with E! News, the actress revealed:</p><p>“We’re constructing our ideal home.” We’ll all be living under the same roof for the rest of our lives. We have a really atypical marriage, you know, we travel a lot and live in various places. We are not together every day, which I believe is crucial for me. It serves us well.”</p><p>Cuoco, however, filed for divorce after three years of marriage in September 2021, declaring her separation and claiming, “there is no hate or hostility, rather the reverse.”</p><p>Kaley Cuoco admitted to Glamour Magazine in April 2022 for their cover issue that she would never marry again, revealing:</p><p>“I’d want to be in a long-term relationship or partnership.” However, I will never marry again. Certainly not. That might actually be on the cover.”</p><p>Kaley Cuoco has been associated with a number of A-listers, like Kevin Zegers, Henry Cavill, and even her Big Bang Theory co-star Johnny Galecki, since the beginning of her career.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Kaley-Cuoco-2.jpg alt="Kaley Cuoco" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Cuoco and Tom Pelphrey first met at the Ozark premiere. Their boss is said to have set them up. Cuoco told USA Today about her first interaction with him:</p><p>“I turned around when I heard his voice, and it was as if my life had ended or had just begun.” It struck me. It was love at first sight for both of them. We hit it off right away. I feel like I’ve known him all my life, yet I wasn’t prepared for him. We’re eager to start a family.”</p><p>It remains to be seen if Kaley Cuoco’s pregnancy has altered her mind about marriage.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiimqSVrnqkwc6cpmaZnpl6tbvMZqeepKCdv6bFjJqpnmWVrb2mr9OipaBlpJ2yqr6Mn6Crq6RisKm1y51m</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./laurette-spang.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Laurette Spang">&larr;
